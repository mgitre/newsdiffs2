President Trump left the pact in 2018 while ratcheting up economic sanctions and pressure on Iran.</p>\n<p>Iran has blamed Israel for Fakhrizadeh\u2019s death, which has elevated uncertainty in the region after Iranian leaders pledged a \u201cdefinitive punishment\u201d and to respond \u201cat the right time.\u201d</p>\n<p>The debate now is not whether Israel killed Iran\u2019s top nuclear scientist, but why</p>\n<p>\u201cSome say through dialogue and negotiations actions can be taken in order to put an end to such hostility,\u201d Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said in a statement read at Fakhrizadeh\u2019s funeral by a representative, according to a translation by Iranian state television. \u201cThis is not possible, because our enemies oppose the nature of the Islamic Republic establishment. .\u2009.\u2009. They will never put an end to their hostilities toward us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fakhrizadeh was a driving force behind an Iranian effort to build a nuclear weapon, an effort that U.S. intelligence says was abandoned nearly two decades ago. His role in Iran\u2019s current nuclear power programs involving reactors and uranium enrichment was less direct.</p>\n<p>Israel has not officially commented on the Friday attack in keeping with its policy of not speaking out on security matters. Israeli Intelligence Minister Eli Cohen told Israeli radio on Monday that he did not know who was behind the ambush.</p>\n<p>The European Union, the United Nations and Germany, among others, have condemned the assassination and called for restraint. British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said Sunday that Britain was \u201cconcerned\u201d about the killing.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re still waiting to see the full facts, to address the full facts of what\u2019s happened in Iran, but I would say that we stick to the rule of international humanitarian law, which is very clear against targeting civilians,\u201d Raab said.</p>\n<p>Iranian media and officials have reported conflicting accounts of the ambush midday Friday of Fakhrizadeh and his security team. Reports, citing witnesses, initially said that a car bomb went off and that a firefight broke out between his bodyguards and up to 12 assassins who escaped.</p>\n<p>The Fars News Agency, which is close to Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard Corps, reported Sunday that no attackers were present and that the perpetrators instead used a remote-controlled machine gun. Iran\u2019s English-language Press TV added Monday that a weapon with an Israeli logo was located at the scene. Ali Shamkhani, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council of Iran, told state TV that Iranian opposition groups in exile were also involved, Reuters reported.</p>\n<p>Fakhrizadeh\u2019s killing recalled the shadowy assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists a decade ago, which Iran also blamed on Israel.</p>\n<p>The scientist was buried in Tehran in a ceremony attended by Iranian officials and family members but closed to the public because of coronavirus-related restrictions. Over the weekend, his body was flown to the city of Mashhad, where it was taken in a procession to the revered Imam Reza shrine, and then to the holy city of Qom.</p>\n<p>Iran\u2019s government provided Fakhrizadeh\u2019s funeral the same high-level honors that it did for Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani, whom the United States killed in Iraq in January. Hundreds of thousands attended Soleimani\u2019s funeral processions, and dozens died in resulting stampedes.</p>\n<p>Soon after Fakhrizadeh\u2019s death, artwork began circulating online of the scientist alongside Soleimani and Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis \u2014 three high-level figures assassinated this year.</p>\n<p>In his statement Monday, Khamenei promised to \u201cfind the perpetrators of the plot and follow up on [Fakhrizadeh\u2019s] research efforts.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fakhrizadeh\u2019s death has emboldened critics of President Hassan Rouhani, a centrist reformer who has championed dialogue and Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with the United States and five other world powers.</p>\n<p>Iran\u2019s parliament met Sunday for a closed-door intelligence briefing about Fakhrizadeh\u2019s assassination. Abolfazl Amouyee, a spokesman for the Iranian parliament\u2019s National Security and Foreign Policy Commission, accused the international inspectors tasked with monitoring the country\u2019s nuclear power program of possible espionage and called for their access to be limited. \u201cWe are sensitive toward the espionage of the IAEA inspectors,\u201d Amouyee said, according to Fars, referring to the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>\n<p>Karim Sadjadpour, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said in a tweet Sunday that Iran\u2019s leadership now faces a dilemma over how to respond to Fakhrizadeh\u2019s killing without compromising other demands, such as U.S. sanctions relief. \u201cTo restore its economy Iran needs a full or partial return to the nuclear deal. To restore deterrence/pride it will want to avenge Fakhrizadeh\u2019s death. Doing the latter without sabotaging the former is most difficult. That\u2019s one reason why Fakhrizadeh was killed.\u201d</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The assassination of top Iranian nuclear scientist raises the stakes for Biden</p>\n<p>Iran\u2019s president blames Israel for killing nuclear scientist and vows to respond at the \u2018right time\u2019</p>\n<p>Iraq fears Trump\u2019s final weeks could see confrontation between U.S. and Iran</p>"

                "body": "<p>Part of what makes President Trump\u2019s hold over the Republican Party so powerful is that the Republican establishment doesn\u2019t fully understand it. And that means it is unsure about how to wield it without Trump helping.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s manifesting in an ugly way for the party in Georgia. As Trump tries to burn down democratic institutions on his way out of office, at least some hardcore Trump supporters in the state are turning on the GOP.</p>\n<p>This couldn\u2019t come at a worse time for the party. Republicans are trying to rally their loyalists to vote Jan. 5 in two Senate runoff races that will decide whether Democrats have full governing control in Washington next year or Republicans can block some of their policies.</p>\n<p>But almost all the establishment Republican figures in Georgia or campaigning there have recently faced accusations from some voters that they\u2019re not Trumpian enough for not wading completely into the president\u2019s baseless claims that the election was stolen from him. Recent examples include:</p>\n<p>Trump\u2019s baseless election fraud claims in Georgia turn Senate runoffs into a \u2018high-wire act\u2019 for Republicans</p>\n<p>The Trump wing of the Republican Party was always at risk of detaching from the party establishment. Trump is such a singular figure in U.S. politics, few if any can emulate him. He\u2019s just willing to say things that get certain voters riled up that other politicians won\u2019t. That\u2019s the crux of the problem Georgia Republicans face.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s tough to gauge how much of an issue this is for Republicans. Are these just a small group of voters showing up at campaign rallies, feeling disenfranchised because Joe Biden won the state and Trump lost reelection? Or are they indicative of a more widespread sentiment of disgust with the Republican Party after Trump\u2019s loss?</p>\n<p>The latter is certainly worse than the former for Republicans, but both are bad. Whichever side wins these two runoff races will have turned out its base in higher numbers. November\u2019s results revealed there are voters who supported Republicans in the Senate races and Biden for president who aren\u2019t as amenable to Trump\u2019s baseless conspiracy theories. But to win, Republicans are also going to need Trump voters. \u201cWhat we\u2019re going to have to do is make sure we get all the votes out from the general and get them back out,\u201d Perdue said of core Republican voters on a private call with donors this month.</p>\n<p>Republicans are concerned enough that allies of Donald Trump Jr. are setting up a super PAC aimed at persuading the president\u2019s supporters in Georgia to vote, Politico reports. The president has somewhat confusingly and halfheartedly told Georgia voters they need to vote, even though he claims the state\u2019s election system can\u2019t be trusted. \u201cI think you\u2019re dealing [with] a very fraudulent system,\u201d President Trump told reporters on Thanksgiving, speaking about Georgia. \u201cI\u2019m very worried about that. They are tremendous people. Kelly Loeffler, David Perdue are tremendous people. They should be in the United States Senate. They\u2019re desperately needed. But I told them today, I said, \u2018Listen, you have a fraudulent system.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p>Three days later, he was back to falsely saying voting machines such as the ones used in Georgia miscounted votes against him.</p>"

                "body": "<p>Look at her. Because despite her protestations, that is what Melania Trump would like you to do. That\u2019s what supporters find solace in doing. Let your gaze linger.</p>\n<p>In her final Christmas video, the one produced during a pandemic, Trump emerges into frame on a staircase landing high above a tree-filled hallway, while wearing a shimmering blouse and slim skirt. She strolls through the White House and marvels at the handiwork of others \u2014 who remain unseen. She doesn\u2019t hang a bauble and she most certainly doesn\u2019t step into the kitchen for a peek at the secrets behind the 25 pounds of icing on the gingerbread White House.</p>\n<p>The decorations, themed to \u201cAmerica the Beautiful,\u201d mark the 100th anniversary of the 19th amendment, celebrate first responders and highlight the country\u2019s wildlife. Trump goes it alone in this slow-motion video that eschews behind-the-scenes flashes of the many masked volunteers who climbed atop ladders and wielded glue guns. There are no references to socially distanced team work. She\u2019s not guiding the public in an intimate virtual tour.</p>\n<p>The video is a high-glamour narrative in which she is the star.</p>\n<p>Four years ago, Trump promised something different. It seemed as though she would follow the lead of her most recent predecessors and aim to stride, as much as possible, in step with regular folks. There\u2019s no way for a first lady to truly be relatable once she steps inside the White House bubble, but in the past the goal has always been to at least try. To give the illusion of a connection where only politicking exists.</p>\n<p>And so, in the beginning \u2014 in 2017 \u2014 in the first video dedicated to the White House holiday decor, the first lady was depicted tying bright red bows onto wreaths, inspecting sugar cookies in the kitchen and adjusting ornaments while dressed casually in dark trousers and an oversize gray sweater. Chefs and assistants and other hard-working elves have notable cameos.</p>\n<p>The president is golfing and exercising White male privilege</p>\n<p>It was all of a piece with a September event that same year. Trump appeared in the White House Kitchen Garden with a group of local youngsters to underscore the importance of healthy eating and to let the public know that she intended to work with the National Park Service to maintain the symbolic vegetable plot that Michelle Obama had sowed. For the occasion, Trump wore black pants and an expensive Balmain red flannel shirt, which sparked the same sort of hand-wringing that Obama\u2019s pricey Lanvin sneakers caused when she wore them to a food bank. Such was the nature of controversy back then.</p>\n<p>The 2018 video unveiling no longer featured Trump in the kitchen, but she was examining the floor plans for her forest of red Christmas trees. She wasn\u2019t so much as hanging ornaments as fingering those that had already been hung. By 2019, it was as though she was just passing through the public rooms on her way to an event to which the masses were not invited. Her ivory coat was draped over her shoulders. She paused to sprinkle a bit of faux snow onto a tree, and the camera zoomed in to capture her perfectly manicured fingernails.</p>\n<p>As has long been the case, the holiday decorating is done by an army of professionals and volunteers, but the responsibility for making sure that the White House glows with seasonal warmth falls to the first lady, whether she likes it or not. An audio recording that captures Trump speaking privately to her former aide and friend Stephanie Winston Wolkoff makes it plain that worrying about Christmas decorations is most definitely something that the first lady does not appreciate. This may explain why, in the video, Trump seems to be playing the part of a mildly amused noblewoman.</p>\n<p>This is where we are in this moment that begs for connection. Trump leaves us floating in vacuum.</p>\n<p>Over four years, the first lady has come into her own. Her place is on a pedestal where so many others have stood, oftentimes uncomfortably, often trying to make room for others. And she seems perfectly content there.</p>\n<p>Alone. Like an objet d\u2019art.</p>\n<p>Gaze upon her. Do so without guilt, because she has actively chosen this passive, inscrutable role. But do it with discomfort and uneasiness because of the enthusiasm with which her choice has been received by some. The first lady has positioned herself as this country\u2019s version of Marianne \u2014 the embodiment of the French republic.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s an identity that so many other first ladies have publicly fought against. They struggled with the attention paid to their attire and to their appearance, even if they enjoyed fashion and the pleasures of dressing up. When the focus was inevitable, they used their clothing to tell a story \u2014 not about themselves, but about an industry, a place, a diplomatic urgency or America itself. Trump has not felt compelled to even put American designers first when selecting her public wardrobe. Some might argue that she was freed of that obligation when so many in the fashion industry denounced her before her husband had even taken the oath of office and glossy magazines begrudged her glowing cover stories. But does she not have an obligation, just as the president does, to be bigger than her biggest detractors?</p>\n<p>During a trip to various countries in Africa, she lamented her wish that news media \u201cfocus on what I do, not what I wear.\u201d This was after wearing a pith helmet in Kenya. But mostly what she has done is to look very nice \u2014 or curiously ill-tempered \u2014 in pictures.</p>\n<p>That, however, appears to be enough for her supporters. They see in her someone to admire, regularly describing her as elegant and classy, not because of her words \u2014 which are few \u2014 or her deeds, but because of her appearance. Because of the way that she stands onstage and embodies a particular vision of womanhood in America. Gaze upon her: tall and thin and White.</p>\n<p>If Obama, with her Ivy League degrees and supermom bona fides, fought against the caustic assumptions about Black women\u2019s femininity, intelligence and humanity, Trump has been a beacon for many of those who held firm in their refusal to consider Obama\u2019s dogged arguments.</p>\n<p>Elegance is perceived in Trump\u2019s physique, because this is a country that despite all of its verbiage about body positivity and inclusivity still measures all female bodies against the sort in which Trump moves through life. She is classy because she evokes an image of a place where others aspire to be, which is to say that they see in her a righteous inevitability. She isn\u2019t breaking any rules; she\u2019s offering reassurance that the rules still apply. She is comfortably alone on her pedestal.</p>\n<p>Trump is not a change maker, which is her greatest allure. Policies can be diluted. Legislation can be overturned. A \u201cfirst\u201d can sometimes end up being \u201cthe only.\u201d Trump has shaped herself into a symbol, and supporters have bestowed it with meaning. To her admirers, she is a symbol of the way things are supposed to be and how things are supposed to look.</p>\n<p>And symbols, the longer we gaze upon them, can be stubbornly difficult to dislodge.</p>"

Its argument: We actually did it first.</p>\n<p>Trump White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany cried foul from her personal Twitter account Sunday night.</p>\n<p>\u201cPresident @realDonaldTrump already has an ALL FEMALE Senior White House Press Team,\u201d McEnany said. \u201cSo does @VP \u2026 So does @FLOTUS \u2026 So does @SecondLady \u2026 The completely DISCREDITED @washingtonpost once again reveals their blinding propagandist Fake News proclivities.\u201d</p>\n<p>The message was promoted by others at the White House and self-styled conservative media watchdogs.</p>\n<p>There are two problems with this.</p>\n<p>The first is that, objectively, Biden\u2019s team will be more female. As plenty of people noted after McEnany tweeted what she did, Judd Deere carries the title of deputy assistant to Trump and deputy press secretary. Brian Morgenstern is also a deputy press secretary and deputy communications director. Biden\u2019s principal deputy press secretary will be Karine Jean-Pierre, while his deputy communications director will be another woman, Pili Tobar.</p>\n<p>Reasonable people can disagree about whether those are technically \u201csenior\u201d roles. Deere for one seemed to agree that he\u2019s not in a senior role, retweeting McEnany\u2019s tweet and drafting his own version of the same complaint.</p>\n<p>But the same is true when it comes to Vice President-elect Kamala D. Harris\u2019s press team. Her top spokesperson will be Symone Sanders. That job is now filled by Devin O\u2019Malley.</p>\n<p>In other words, three of the seven jobs Biden filled Sunday have men serving in the equivalent roles in the Trump White House. Call it \u201csenior\u201d or anything else, the Biden White House\u2019s communications team will feature significantly more women.</p>\n<p>The second problem, though, is that McEnany et al. are erecting a straw man. The headline McEnany featured in her tweet said merely that Biden had appointed an all-female senior communications team, which is true no matter how you define \u201csenior.\u201d The headline doesn\u2019t reference a claim that this is in some way unprecedented or that Trump didn\u2019t do the same. Yet McEnany suggested that headline was somehow \u201cfake news\u201d that discredits The Post.</p>\n<p>The Post report does include a reference along these lines: \u201cIt is the first time all of the top aides tasked with speaking on behalf of an administration and shaping its message will be female.\u201d Again, we can debate \u201ctop,\u201d just as we can debate \u201csenior.\u201d But, again, three of the seven jobs that were just filled by women are now held by men. And those are unquestionably top jobs when it comes to \u201cspeaking on behalf of the administration\u201d; Deere and Morgenstern do a large chunk of that work for the Trump White House, as reporters will attest.</p>\n<p>The Trump White House has elevated women to the top communications jobs frequently. There is no questioning that. But this is a thoroughly odd parsing by the White House \u2014 almost as if it is looking for things to complain about.</p>"

The Moscow Times identified the couple as co-writers.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs someone who is part of an ethnic minority in Russia, Tigran regularly makes fun, on the air, of his large \u2018ethnic\u2019 nose and his belonging to a \u2018black\u2019 community,\u201d Simonyan wrote, referring to a derogatory term used by some in Russia to describe Armenians and others from the Caucasus. Simonyan and Keosayan are ethnically Armenian.</p>\n<p>On Twitter, some Russians criticized the segment. Alexei Navalny \u2014 the critic of the Kremlin who was hospitalized earlier this year after he was poisoned by a nerve agent \u2014 wrote sarcastically that he couldn\u2019t ignore \u201canother masterpiece\u201d from the pair.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me remind you, Keosayan has sent his daughter to study in New York,\u201d he wrote.</p>\n<p>Several Russian tabloids and TV channels published derogatory content about Obama while he was in office. One TV anchor, describing President Trump\u2019s first visit to the White House, said Trump acted like \u201can English lord\u201d and Obama \u201cwas throwing his arms about as if he was in a jungle,\u201d the Moscow Times reported in 2016. The segment was later deleted.</p>\n<p>Several Russian businesses \u2014 including a carwash and an ice cream company \u2014 have also invoked Obama\u2019s name alongside racist imaging or slogans for their products.</p>\n<p>In 2015, footage from a Moscow Red Bull Flugtag contest \u2014 in which participants build homemade flying contraptions \u2014 showed several people wearing blackface and chasing a banana. One was wearing an Obama mask. The energy-drink company apologized after it published a \u201cBest of Moscow Flugtag\u201d video featuring the racist portrayals.</p>\n<p>A spokesman, Vadim Shevchenko, initially told the Guardian: \u201cOf course it\u2019s not an expression of racism. The situation was absolutely friendly and happy.\u201d</p>\n<p>But the company later removed the video and told Time magazine it would take more steps to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future. The organizers \u201cregret our oversight in allowing these participants to tarnish what was otherwise an enjoyable event,\u201d the company said in a statement.</p>\n<p>In the United States, blackface is understood to evoke a painful, racist history of minstrel shows, which mocked enslaved and marginalized Black people. Other countries have in recent years faced their own moments of reckoning with the practice, including in response to portrayals of Obama.</p>\n<p>Last year, Italian national air carrier Alitalia released an advertisement for a flight between Rome and Washington, featuring actors playing several former U.S. presidents. The actor playing Obama wore blackface.</p>\n<p>The company withdrew the video and apologized on Twitter. \u201cIt was never our intention to hurt anyone and we will learn from what has happened,\u201d the statement said.</p>"

How can I save an elephant who\u2019s been shackled to a shed for 17 years and who is a thousand miles away?\u201d</p>\n<p>Freeing Kaavan has been no simple task. Those close to the animal spent weeks training him to calmly enter and exit the custom-built crate designed to transport a 5.5-ton mammal. The Asian elephant\u2019s trainers now know that music soothes his anxiety \u2014 something Cher has been happy to help with.</p>\n<p>Despite initial concerns for the animal\u2019s welfare, Amir Khalil, a veterinarian working at Four Paws, said Kaavan did not appear to be stressed during the seven-hour flight to his new home, describing the journey aboard an Ilyushin IL-76 plane to Cambodia as \u201cuneventful.\u201d In fact, Kaavan displayed signs of \u201ca frequent flier,\u201d eating, sleeping, relaxing and seemingly enjoying the ride, Khalil said Monday.</p>\n<p>Cher, who co-founded the international animal charity Free the Wild, was photographed Monday holding a flower and wearing a face covering as she waited for Kaavan\u2019s crate \u2014 lovingly hand-painted with illustrations and the message \u201cFree Kaavan\u201d \u2014 to touch down at Cambodia\u2019s Siem Reap International Airport.</p>\n<p>Kaavan will soon be transported to Cambodia Wildlife Sanctuary, where staff say a \u201cjuicy fruitcake\u201d and \u201cwelcoming committee\u201d await him \u2014 along with female neighbors who are expected to keep him company as he begins a new chapter in an environment where he\u2019ll be safe and free to roam.</p>\n<p>\u201cCambodia is pleased to welcome Kaavan,\u201d the nation\u2019s deputy environment minister, Neth Pheaktra, said. \u201cNo longer will he be \u2018the world\u2019s loneliest elephant.' \u201d</p>\n<p>The \u2018world\u2019s loneliest elephant\u2019 is finally cleared to find a new home</p>\n<p>The hashtag #FreeKaavan has long been used on social media by animal activists, who have spent years campaigning for the animals kept in confinement at the Islamabad zoo to be given a better life.</p>\n<p>After mounting pressure, fueled in part by Cher\u2019s campaign, Islamabad\u2019s high court ruled in May that the zoo\u2019s conditions \u201camount to subjecting (animals) to unnecessary pain and suffering,\u201d and called for all animals held at the zoo to be relocated to sanctuaries.</p>\n<p>The abysmal conditions at the zoo have faced intense scrutiny for years. Officials at the facility have blamed insufficient funding and poor training, but Pakistani authorities have also failed to enforce animal-care regulations. Many of the animals left in the capital city\u2019s zoo are living in cramped conditions that rights groups have described as \u201cabhorrent and unacceptable.\u201d</p>\n<p>One attempted transfer ended tragically after animal handlers lit a fire in a big-cat enclosure to force two lions into transportation crates. Both died of smoke inhalation.</p>\n<p>Some of the last animals waiting to be moved include two retired dancing bears, who are suffering from behavioral disorders because of illness and lack of space. The bears are set to be transferred to Jordan in the coming months, according to Four Paws.</p>\n<p>Kaavan was gifted to Pakistan by Sri Lanka in 1985, when the elephant was just a baby.</p>\n<p>Elephants are social animals and a solitary lifestyle can lead to boredom and behavioral problems; following the death of Kaavan\u2019s zoo partner, who lived with him, Saheli, his mental and physical health deteriorated, according to experts, who note that along with being malnourished, he has displayed a range of physical and psychological issues.</p>\n<p>Last week Cher met with Prime Minister Imran Khan, who she later thanked for his help in \u201cmaking it possible\u201d for her to take the Asian elephant to Cambodia on a flight that left Pakistan on Sunday.</p>\n<p>Khan thanked Cher for her efforts and invited her to participate further in environmental initiatives in Pakistan, according to a statement from the prime minister\u2019s office.</p>\n<p>Ahead of his long-awaited departure, supporters at the zoo threw a goodbye party for Kaavan, with balloons, colorful bunting and live music.</p>\n<p>Then, on Sunday, Four Paws tweeted a photograph of Kaavan\u2019s enclosure, which now lies empty for the first time in 35 years.</p>\n<p>\u201cDreams do come true!\u201d the organization wrote as activists celebrated the success of the rescue mission \u2014 one that animal lovers, along with Kaavan, the now-not-so-lonely-elephant, will surely never forget.</p>\n<p>Read more: </p>\n<p>The coronavirus pandemic has halted tourism, and animals are benefiting from it</p>\n<p>These haunting animal photos aim to make you reconsider a visit to the zoo</p>\n<p>What happens when an old elephant dies?

                "byline": "By Aaron Blake",
                "body": "<p>President Trump did something this weekend that would have been unimaginable two years ago: He attacked Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) as being soft on voter fraud.</p>\n<p>Yes, that Brian Kemp.</p>\n<p>If there is a moment that speaks to the Trump campaign\u2019s far-flung and unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud and irregularities, it might be Trump\u2019s burgeoning rift with Georgia\u2019s governor. Kemp, after all, had been a contender for Public Enemy No. 1 for Democrats in recent years when it comes to allegedly overambitious efforts to tackle fraud. They have frequently accused him of thinly veiled attempts to suppress the votes of minorities, in particular. All of that came to a head in 2018 when he narrowly won his gubernatorial election after purging more than a million voters from Georgia\u2019s rolls as secretary of state.</p>\n<p>To Trump, though, Kemp is apparently something amounting to a RINO \u2014 Republican in Name Only.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe governor\u2019s done nothing,\u201d Trump complained Sunday on Fox News Channel. \u201cHe\u2019s done absolutely nothing. I\u2019m ashamed that I endorsed him. But I look at what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s so terrible.\u201d</p>\n<p>Trump then tweeted at Kemp on Monday morning, calling him the \u201chapless Governor of Georgia\u201d and urging him to overrule Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R).</p>\n<p>Leaning on public officials is one thing, but the specific public officials being leaned on is quite another. Both Kemp and Raffensperger have repeatedly warned about voter fraud in recent years, often taking steps derided by Democrats.</p>\n<p>At the top of that list is Kemp. Democrats labeled his effort to remove more than a million voters from Georgia\u2019s voter rolls as voter suppression. More than half a million were purged on a single day in 2017, including more than 100,000 for not voting in recent elections. He also drew heat for holding up more than 50,000 new registrations on the eve of the 2018 election, citing a strict and contentious state law.</p>\n<p>But his controversial history with combating supposed fraud dates back well before then.</p>\n<p>While running for secretary of state in 2009, Kemp made voter fraud his calling card, saying, \u201cIf it comes down on my watch, we\u2019ll come down on them hard.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shortly after assuming office in January 2010, he launched a Stop Voter Fraud website and hotline.</p>\n<p>He quickly emerged as a major proponent of voter ID bills. In 2010, he testified in front of Texas legislators considering a bill similar to one passed in Georgia. Rep. Marc Veasey (D-Tex.) accused Republicans like Kemp of trying to \u201cskim\u201d marginal Democratic voters off the top. Kemp defended the effort by saying, \u201cWe have not disenfranchised anyone \u2026 especially any minority group.\u201d</p>\n<p>In 2011, he wrote a Washington Post letter to the editor in which he rebuked columnist E.J. Dionne for arguing that voter ID laws were meant to discourage voting. \u201cMr. Dionne argued that photo ID and related election-security laws are not needed because voter fraud \u2018is not a major problem,\u2019 \u201d Kemp wrote. \u201cAs chairman of the Georgia State Election Board, I can attest that every year we investigate and penalize hundreds of people guilty of election and voter fraud, and we work with county district attorneys to prosecute them on criminal charges.\u201d</p>\n<p>In 2013, he argued against same-day voter registration by citing fraud. The same year, the Supreme Court ruled against requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote, with none other than conservative Justice Antonin Scalia writing the lopsided 7-to-2 opinion. Kemp said he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d with the ruling.</p>\n<p>From the start of his tenure as secretary of state until his election as governor, Kemp purged about 1.4 million voters from Georgia\u2019s rolls, with Democratic opponent Stacey Abrams long questioning his legitimacy because of it. After he won the 2018 race for governor, the newly Democratic-controlled U.S. House sent letters to him and his successor, Raffensperger, saying they were investigating the situation.</p>\n<p>And while Raffensperger has recently emerged as a key voice when it comes to the integrity of the 2020 vote, he, too, has found himself under fire for his actions. He continued Kemp\u2019s purge in 2019, with more than 300,000 purged \u2014 a number that made up about 4 percent of the state\u2019s voter base.</p>\n<p>As with Kemp, when Raffensperger was first running for secretary of state, voter fraud was a key focus of the GOP primary and beyond. At the time, Raffensperger repeatedly said his goal was \u201cto make sure only Americans vote in our elections.\u201d</p>\n<p>He added in that campaign that absentee ballots were \u201cthe greatest doorway to voter fraud.\u201d He also called absentee voting \u201cthe biggest entry point for voter fraud.\u201d</p>\n<p>In April, with mail ballots expanding amid the coronavirus outbreak \u2014 in a move somewhat similar to Kemp\u2019s a decade prior \u2014 Raffensperger launched a task force to root out potential fraud. The state Democratic Party at the time called it \u201cstate-sponsored voter intimidation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Raffensperger also earned Democrats\u2019 ire when in September he launched an inquiry into and threatened criminal action against 1,000 people he said had cast multiple ballots in the state\u2019s primary. He said at the time that he was unconcerned whether it was done intentionally or unintentionally, citing one person who was allegedly \u201cbragging\u201d about voting twice.</p>\n<p>\u201cAt the end of the day, the voter was responsible, and the voters know what they were doing,\u201d Raffensperger said. \u201cA double voter knows exactly what they were doing, diluting the votes of each and every voter that follows the law.\u201d</p>\n<p>That this man has now, less than three months later, been branded by Trump allies as a squish on voter fraud is pretty indicative of where we are in this moment. That he is now joined in that distinction by Kemp is even more of a statement. And that they are joined in the White House\u2019s crosshairs by another Republican who rooted out actual fraud in Philadelphia \u2014 City Commissioner Al Schmidt (R) \u2014 but has downplayed concerns about this election tells you just about all you need to know about the actual evidence here.</p>\n<p>Many Republicans have been pretty quiet about Trump\u2019s allegations. But perhaps the bigger point is that others who have shown a real desire to focus on alleged fraud have been unwilling to go along with the charade. And they\u2019ve been doing it undoubtedly knowing full well that these Trump nasty-grams awaited them.</p>"

                "body": "<p>In the years-long competition among Fox employees to demonstrate the most obsequiousness to President Trump, it seemed unlikely that anyone might be able to surpass Sean Hannity\u2019s robust lead. Maria Bartiromo, though, is making a late charge.</p>\n<p>She was always in the running, of course. An interview she conducted with Trump in April 2019 was in the style of a sixth-grader interviewing her loquacious parent for a Career Day assignment. A month before the election, she let Trump ramble for an hour about the risks posed by mail-in voting, an obviously false argument that Bartiromo did literally nothing to contest.</p>\n<p>In an interview Sunday, though, things were quite different: Bartiromo let Trump delineate his nonsensical claims about purported fraud for only about 45 minutes.</p>\n<p>Her first question did nothing more than tee up Trump\u2019s utterly baseless allegations that somehow he won the 2020 presidential contest.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease go through the facts,\u201d she said to the most demonstrably facts-free president in American history. \u201cCharacterize what took place.\u201d</p>\n<p>As he spoke for more than six minutes, Bartiromo\u2019s sole interjections were with the following words, in this order: \u201cRight,\u201d \u201cyes,\u201d \u201cyes,\u201d \u201cyes,\u201d \u201cright\u201d and \u201cyes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Later, she marveled over an article from the hard-right website Federalist in which, among other things, the author presented as suspect the idea that President-elect Joe Biden might have received a historic number of votes in an election that occurred when the United States had never had a larger population.</p>\n<p>The entire 45 minutes had one goal: offering Trump a platform to regurgitate his allegations about the election. Bartiromo seems to believe that the nefarious things alleged by Trump occurred, a concern in and of itself. But the interview was an excellent demonstration of the extent to which Fox News, Fox Business and fringier cable-news outlets serve to legitimize even the most ridiculous claims made by Trump.</p>\n<p>Over the past few years, we\u2019ve seen an interesting dynamic emerge on cable television. The splintered universe of providers has provided more platforms for sharply partisan networks. One effect is to create news-like products that, save for nuances of production quality, might strike a casual observer as legitimate \u2014 the same way a partisan news website might mimic a local newspaper or the way fringe journalists might appear as legitimate on social media as any other reporter.</p>\n<p>If you tune into One America News or Newsmax, for example, you\u2019re presented with cable-news-like programming. Anchors sitting at desks. Reporters with microphones standing in front of buildings. The same sorts of things you would see on CNN or MSNBC in the abstract but with the important distinction that there\u2019s no sincere effort to present things objectively or even, at times, to vet the information being received.</p>\n<p>OAN, in particular, tends to present as fact anything that comes across its transom. Its star reporter, Chanel Rion, once \u201creported\u201d that the coronavirus at the heart of this year\u2019s pandemic had been created in North Carolina, apparently because someone on Twitter said it had been. Last week, the network\u2019s lower-third announced that, according to an unidentified \u201creport,\u201d 6,000 fake ballots for  Biden had been found in Arizona. It was a data error.</p>\n<p>Vice News pointed out last week that OAN\u2019s news-like veneer allowed Trump to make false claims that were then uncritically reiterated \u2014 and expanded upon \u2014 by the network. It\u2019s reputation-laundering: nonsense from Trump or his supporters are offered up by a photogenic network personality while a crawl of news-seeming things moves along the bottom of the screen. Trump will often then tweet the segments out to his millions of supporters, a useful bit of advertising for the upstarts.</p>\n<p>Trump sometimes advertises for them directly, generally as a side effect of trying to pressure Fox News to offer even more fawning coverage than it already does.</p>\n<p>Imagine having the audacity to interview a non-Republican!</p>\n<p>This is explicitly the point: Trump wants people watching uncritical coverage of his presidency, both by tuning to networks already doing so and by pressuring Fox to expand its sycophancy. The president often talks about how important his Twitter feed is to speaking directly to his base, but it\u2019s clear that he also understands the usefulness of his supportive cable-news networks in doing so. Fox News, for example, is the most-watched news network in the country, and its most loyal viewers are also the most fervently supportive of Trump.</p>\n<p>This symbiosis of boosting Trump to get his approval is not subtle. Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy was asked by the New Yorker\u2019s Issac Chotiner last week whether his network didn\u2019t have an obligation to evaluate Trump\u2019s claims about fraud before presenting them to its viewers.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think before we even make the claim, we should say, \u2018Hey, look at this anomaly. Why is this the case?\u2019 And we start asking about it,\u201d Ruddy said. \u201cBut you know what? At the end of the day, it\u2019s great for news. The news cycle is red-hot, and Newsmax is getting one million people per minute, according to Nielsen, tuning into Newsmax TV. I think it\u2019s good.\u201d</p>\n<p>In another interview with the New York Times, Ruddy tried to rationalize amplifying Trump\u2019s false claims by noting that there had been years of investigations into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election and possible overlap with Trump\u2019s campaign. Reports in outlets such as The Washington Post, however, were both vetted and eventually substantiated by investigation conducted by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. Trump\u2019s claims are not vetted before being offered to Ruddy\u2019s audience.</p>\n<p>That includes claims Trump made in a brief news conference he held over the weekend, which Newsmax aired in its entirety \u2014 with Trump\u2019s promotion. It includes statements from one of his attorneys about his beyond-long-shot legal challenge in Nevada, also amplified by the president. One America News does the same thing, lifting up claims from Trump\u2019s camp, spit-shining them with some newsy aesthetics and enjoying Trump\u2019s subsequent boost.</p>\n<p>Again, it\u2019s not just these channels that are giving him a pass. Trump\u2019s claims are also not vetted when they come directly from the president himself in an interview on Fox. There, too, they are just offered up as another element of the news conversation, presented as little segments of analysis that the progenitor can later tweet out, as though by appearing on Fox they have somehow been validated.</p>\n<p>Which Trump did Sunday, sharing four different snippets of his interview with Bartiromo, in which she mostly nods along as he says obviously false things. The only indicator that perhaps Trump wasn\u2019t being entirely forthright with the listener is Twitter\u2019s wan \u201cThis claim about election fraud is disputed.\u201d</p>\n<p>When the interview aired on Fox News, there were no disclaimers at all, just as Trump likes it.</p>"

                "body": "<p>The 2020 presidential contest ended four weeks ago Tuesday, but for President Trump and his allies, the fight continues. The president, as you\u2019re no doubt well aware, continues to insist that it was he, and not President-elect Joe Biden, who won the election. There is no evidence that this is true in any sense; Trump lost the electoral college by the same margin with which he won it four years ago, even as he lost the popular vote by a much wider margin.</p>\n<p>Through some combination of dishonesty and delusion, though, Trump maintains  that he won by a wide margin. To bolster his case, he has elevated various scattershot theories aimed loosely at suggesting that something \u2014 anything! \u2014 sketchy may have occurred. Those theories ebb and evolve depending on how ludicrous they are shown to be, meaning that the collection of falsehoods itself changes over time.</p>\n<p>Given the ongoing effort to elevate various claims, we thought it worthwhile to catalogue some of the more common assertions. Each of the claims in bold below is false, as the text that follows demonstrates. Feel free to use this as a one-stop rebuttal to Trump\u2019s claims; if other assertions warrant future inclusion, we\u2019ll add them.</p>\n<p>If there is any real evidence of fraud, Mr. President, it\u2019s time to put up</p>\n<p>1.8 million ballots were mailed out in Pennsylvania, but 2.5 million were returned. This claim conflates ballots sent in the primary (1.8 million) with the number returned (2.6 million) in the general. More than 3 million ballots were requested for the general election.</p>\n<p>Biden\u2019s leads in key states are a function of the suspicious addition of large numbers of ballots. It is true that large batches of votes shifted the lead in several states. The important distinction, though, is that this is not evidence of anything suspicious or nefarious occurring.</p>\n<p>Take Wisconsin, for example. The sudden surge in votes that has prompted consternation from Trump and his allies was the reporting of results from Milwaukee County, where more than 1 in 8 votes statewide were cast. Those votes went heavily for Biden, just as they had gone heavily for Hillary Clinton in 2016.</p>\n<p>If votes were being added illicitly, either a number of counties \u2014 and county administrators \u2014 would have had to be in on the fix or one county would see a wide deviation from its results in 2016. There\u2019s no evidence that this happened.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s inconceivable that Biden received 80 million votes. It isn\u2019t. Never have there been more people living in the United States and, by extension, more citizens of voting age. As we reported last week, although Biden\u2019s vote total is higher than that of any candidate in history, as a percentage of the population that is eligible to vote, it\u2019s somewhere among the top-10 performances in history.</p>\n<p>That doesn\u2019t answer the question of how Biden did so well. The answer to that question, though, is also simple: He was running against Trump. Trump has been the most polarizing president in history, with a majority of Americans disapproving of his job performance and with fervent opposition from most Democrats and many independents. Polling showed that many of them were motivated to vote not by Biden but by Trump. Trump likes to tout how energetic his supporters were \u2014 but to ignore the energy of his opponents.</p>\n<p>It can\u2019t be the case that Biden received more votes from Black voters than Barack Obama did. Again, it can, for the same reasons as above.</p>\n<p>We should note first that this assertion isn\u2019t proved. If we apply exit poll data to the vote totals in 2008, 2012 and 2020 \u2014 a fraught endeavor, given margins of error \u2014 we see that Biden received an estimated 17.7 million Black votes while Obama received 16.2 million in 2008 and fewer in 2012. But, again, there are millions more Black Americans in the United States than there were 12 years ago. From 2008 to 2017, Census Bureau data indicate that the number of African Americans in the United States increased by more than 11 percent, or 4.3 million.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s interesting about this claim is that Trump supporters broadly try to have it both ways: touting Trump\u2019s faring better with Black voters than past Republican nominees did, which is probably true, while also disparaging the idea that more African Americans voted for Biden.</p>\n<p>More people were reported to have voted in Detroit than live there. The city has data on the presidential election. There were more than 500,000 eligible voters and about 250,000 actual votes cast, a relatively low level of turnout, compared with other places.</p>\n<p>That so many of these claims center on Black voters and heavily Black areas is probably not a coincidence, leveraging long-standing skepticism among Republicans of Black and Democratic cities.</p>\n<p>It is suspicious that Trump lost while so many other Republican candidates were successful. There is only one office for which every American votes at the same time: president. That mutes the effects of partisan polarization at a state or local level: Red states may vote for Republicans and blue ones for Democrats, but everyone votes on the chief executive. In other words, we should expect that there are different partisan effects for nonpresidential races than for presidential ones.</p>\n<p>Again, though, we have to note the way in which Trump is unique. No president in the history of modern polling has been as polarizing, and most Americans (and voters) had strong opinions about his presidency. That seems to have meant that many voters objected to Trump specifically while not objecting to Republicans generally. Much of the ground the GOP gained in 2020 was also being clawed back from the Democratic overperformance in 2018 \u2014 itself a function of Trump\u2019s unpopularity but without the boost to Republicans that Trump\u2019s presence on the ballot offered this year.</p>\n<p>Voting machines shifted the results of the election in Biden\u2019s favor. There\u2019s literally no evidence of this that doesn\u2019t start from the assumption that some fraud must have occurred. It\u2019s a useful deus ex machina, leveraging uncertainty about technology and a black-box process to explain things such as the 80 million Biden votes that Trump and his allies find suspicious in the first place.</p>\n<p>Republicans were prevented from watching votes being tallied, allowing fraud to occur. Here we're deviating from claims of fraud to more esoteric claims that maybe something bad happened. But even this isn't true.</p>\n<p>As votes were counted, including in Pennsylvania, the Trump campaign had advocates observing. The campaign has tried to imply that it didn\u2019t, arguing either that the observers were too far from the counting to be effective or that observers were turned away, which occurred in some places as volunteers showed up to try to root out suspected fraud. Courts have repeatedly ruled against the campaign on this issue.</p>\n<p>Even if one accepts the campaign\u2019s complaints at face value, though, this isn\u2019t proof that any fraud occurred.</p>\n<p>There are hundreds of sworn affidavits proving that fraud occurred. There are not. There are, instead, hundreds of sworn affidavits in which Trump supporters articulate things they saw, usually while serving as untrained volunteers observing the vote-counting process. As we\u2019ve reported repeatedly, those statements rarely even allege fraudulent activity. Most instead document suspicious-seeming things, allegations that the city of Detroit aptly described as being \u201cgrounded in an extraordinary failure to understand how elections function.\u201d</p>\n<p>Just because someone is willing to swear under oath that they saw something happen doesn\u2019t mean that what they saw happen was what they believed it to be.</p>\n<p>Statistical or historic analysis shows that something strange happened with the voting in various states. Analyzing vote totals can be a good way to determine whether something suspicious occurred in an election. But it\u2019s also quite easy to use numbers to whip up uncertainty about unsurprising things. Those batches of votes in key states that are attributable to large counties reporting their results for example, can be whipped up into complex conspiracy theories involving scatter plots and complicated mathematical equations. If you\u2019re lucky, that sciencey appearance might even hoodwink a U.S. senator \u2014 even if the purported anomalies are easily explained by the existence of cities.</p>\n<p>By themselves, in other words, such analyses don't prove fraud but, instead, might suggest it.</p>\n<p>Less reliable are comparisons between this election and elections past. An article on a far-right website, for example, wondered about Biden\u2019s losing \u201ckey bellwether\u201d counties and being the first candidate in 60 years to lose both Florida and Ohio. Those counties are bellwethers, though, as a function of a few decades of recent elections. Even that trend involving Florida and Ohio lasted only 14 elections, a small sample size. It\u2019s also cherry-picked: Trump was the first candidate since 1976 to lose both Nevada and Colorado. So what?</p>\n<p>When considering historic analogies for presidential contests, it\u2019s worth reviewing this XKCD cartoon from 2012.</p>\n<p>Georgia needs to match signatures to ballots for its recount to be valid. One thing that we\u2019ve seen in recent weeks (as in the preceding example) is that the arguments Trump and his allies use evolve into forms that comport with the available evidence. The proof they claim exists is always just out of reach or otherwise unattainable. Trump, for example, claims that the Wisconsin recounts \u2014 which expanded Biden\u2019s lead slightly \u2014 were meant to uncover fraudulent votes, evidence for which would be provided this week. Given that the counting was conducted by counties in the state, that seems unlikely.</p>\n<p>In Georgia, where both an audit and a recount have been conducted, the goal posts lie elsewhere. Trump and his team insist that the actual verification process should mandate that mail-in ballots again be confirmed against voter signatures. The problem with this, obvious to any casual observer of American elections, is that doing so would offer no information about the votes themselves, because vote choices are necessarily separated from the voter. This is the essence of the secret ballot: No one knows for whom you voted. So even if you did find, say, 1,000 suspect signatures, you\u2019d have no idea for whom those people voted.</p>\n<p>One observation that applies both to this claim and the effort in general is this: The goal isn\u2019t to answer questions, it\u2019s to raise them.</p>"

The Trump administration is expected to finalize easing fines before Jan. 20.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<h5>Companies that electrocute, poison and otherwise harm birds stand to benefit from the revision.\u00a0</h5>\n<p>Past administrations have used the law to financially penalize companies whose activities harm gulls, waterfowl and other migratory birds that plunge to their deaths in oil skim pits mistaken for ponds or find themselves dirtied by oil when pipelines break.</p>\n<p>Perhaps most notably, BP pleaded guilty to breaking the law after the disastrous Deepwater Horizon spill killed an estimated 102,000 birds across 93 species.</p>\n<p>The change means future spills would not be prosecuted under the law. In its environmental review, the Fish and Wildlife Service acknowledged that companies would be less likely to take costly steps to prevent harm to birds if they face no legal liability \u2014 leading to more bird deaths.</p>\n<p>Amy Emmert at the American Petroleum Institute, an oil and gas lobbying group, said the change \u201creinforces the original intent of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.\u201d The Fish and Wildlife Service itself says it is promulgating the rule to \"provide legal certainty for the public.\"</p>\n<p>Environmental groups, meanwhile, criticized the Trump administration for what it calls a legally flawed analysis that will lead to unnecessary bird deaths.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAt a time when North America has already lost 3 billion birds, the rule will further undercut our nation\u2019s ability to conserve birds so many people care about deeply,\u201d said Jamie Rappaport Clark, the head of the Defenders of Wildlife.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, a federal judge struck down the administration's first effort to ease restriction on bird killings, which was opposed by 17 former Interior Department officials from both Democratic and Republican presidents.</p>\n<h5>The Trump administration's new rule could impact wind turbine operators, too.\u00a0</h5>\n<p>Trump, who for years fought the construction of a wind farm near his Scottish gold course, likes to complain about the \u201ckilling field\u201d of birds created by collisions with the turbines.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wind turbines are blamed for killing about 250,000 birds a year. But many conservationists argue birds ultimately benefit if those cleaner forms of energy slow down the climate change that is disrupting their habitats.</p>\n<p>Read more here:</p>\n<p>Trump officials move to relax rules on killing birds (Juliet Eilperin and Sarah Kaplan)</p>\n<h3>Power plays</h3>\n<h5>The Trump administration denied a key permit for Alaska\u2019s Pebble Mine.\u00a0</h5>\n<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Wednesday denied a permit for a massive gold and copper mine near Bristol Bay, ruling that it did not comply with the Clean Water Act, our colleagues Juliet Eilperin and Brady Dennis report.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhile the Trump administration has pressed ahead to weaken environmental protections and expand energy development before the president\u2019s term ends in January, the decision to torpedo the long-disputed mine represents a major win for environmentalists, fishing enthusiasts and tribal rights,\u201d Eilperin and Dennis write.</p>\n<p>Environmentalists and tribal groups opposed to the project received a boost when Donald Trump Jr. and Fox News host Tucker Carlson, both of whom have enjoyed hunting and fishing in the area, came out against the project. Then, in September, secret recordings showed top Pebble Mine executives boasting about their influence with lawmakers and claiming the operation could last far beyond the permit requested.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Although the firm behind the Pebble Mine could challenge the decision to deny the permit in court or file an amended application, environmental groups have expressed optimism that the incoming Biden administration will take a harder line on projects that could pollute waterways.</p>\n<p>Biden is expected to nominate Neera Tanden as head of the Office of Management and Budget.</p>\n<p>Tanden, who heads the Center for American Progress, a center-left think tank, will have an outsized role in impacting climate policy. Our colleagues Annie Linskey and Jeff Stein reported the personnel move.</p>\n<p>The OMB exercises considerable power over executive branch rule-making, including through its role in issuing cost-benefit analyses regarding environmental regulations. Tanden and the CAP have been critical of the Trump administration's efforts to cut funding to the EPA and other environmental programs.</p>\n<p>While Tanden is expected to face opposition from some Senate Republicans who see her as too progressive. She\u2019s also had multiple online spats with Sen. Bernie Sanders's (I-Vt.) supporters and some on the left, including the Sunrise Movement, a youth environmental organization, which in 2018 accused her of not being ambitious enough in her climate proposals.</p>\n<h5>A Trump administration rule change may clear the way for strip mining near Okefenokee Swamp.</h5>\n<p>A Trump administration regulation that went into effect this summer rolling back federal protections for 45 million acres of wetlands has paved the way for a titanium mining project just outside the Okefenokee Swamp, a fragile ecosystem in Georgia. While the fate of the project, proposed by an Alabama company called Twin Pines Minerals, is still in question, it is \u201clikely to be the first of a wave of efforts to commercially develop wetlands and tributaries across the nation,\u201d our colleagues Steven Mufson and Desmond Butler report.</p>\n<p>Environmentalists have beat back development proposals near the mine before, including a proposal to mine titanium in a similar area along the swamp in the 1990s, which was soundly rejected by federal regulators. Now, conservation groups have lined up again with lawsuits to challenge the Twin Pines project, setting up a legal test of the Trump administration\u2019s new regulation on protected waters.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Twin Pines Minerals has enlisted the help of lobbying companies, and top mining executives have donated to state officials and to Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), who is up for reelection in a January runoff race.</p>\n<h5>The EPA\u2019s race to roll back environmental protections hits up against staff resistance.</h5>\n<p>As the Trump administration makes a final deregulatory push before the president leaves office on Jan. 20, political appointees are running into resistance from career EPA scientists and other staffers, the New York Times reports.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The former director of the agency\u2019s science advisory office, Thomas Sinks, wrote a blistering opinion about a pending rule that would limit the type of medical research the agency could consider in weighing the public health impacts of pollution and exposure to toxins. The formal dissenting scientific opinion, written before Sinks\u2019s retirement in September, could help Joe Biden if he seeks to repeal the rule.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, career employees emailed out the results of a recent study that showed that many diesel truck owners and operators have been tampering with their vehicles\u2019 emissions controls. Some officials at the Environmental Protection Agency have established back channels with the Biden transition team while awaiting formal approval for the transition process.</p>\n<h3>Climate solutions</h3>\n<h5>An unusual snack for cows could cut back on a potent greenhouse gas.</h5>\n<p>Scientists are looking at the impact of adding seaweed to cows\u2019 diets to neutralize the methane, a potent greenhouse gas, that comes when they burp. Asparagopsis and other types of seaweed make a compound that stops hydrogen and carbon atoms from forming methane in the stomach, potentially providing a solution to cut back on emissions produced by the world\u2019s 1.5 billion cows, Tatiana Schlossberg writes for The Post.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIn lab tests and field trials, adding a small proportion of this seaweed to a cow\u2019s daily feed \u2014 about 0.2 of a percent of the total feed intake in a recent study \u2014 can reduce the amount of methane by 98 percent. That\u2019s a stunning drop when most existing solutions cut methane by about 20 or 30 percent,\u201d Schlossberg writes.</p>\n<h3>Extra mileage</h3>\n<h5>Which one of you took it?</h5>\n<p>\"Stumbled upon by bighorn sheep counters, the tall metal object in the Utah desert baffled officials \u2014 and delighted the public, who began speculating on a scene straight out of a science-fiction movie,\" our colleague Hannah Knowles reports.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow the monolith has vanished, leaving the curious with even more questions.

                "body": "<p>President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s pick to lead the powerful White House budget office generated early controversy Monday, with Neera Tanden emerging as an immediate target for conservatives and Republican lawmakers.</p>\n<p>Tanden, 50, has regularly clashed with the GOP in a manner that Republicans say will complicate her Senate confirmation process. Several GOP senators said Monday that she could run into trouble during confirmation hearings, warning that her \u201cpartisan\u201d background could make it hard for her to win Republican support.</p>\n<p>The two Senate Republicans poised to lead committees that would hold Tanden\u2019s confirmation hearings both declined to commit to doing so. One of them \u2014 Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), who is in line to chair the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee \u2014 also said he hopes that Biden will decide not to formally nominate Tanden.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe concern I have is both judgment, based on the tweets that I\u2019ve been shown, just in the last 24 hours \u2026 and it\u2019s the partisan nature,\u201d said Portman, a former Office of Management and Budget director himself. \u201cOf all the jobs, that\u2019s one where I think you would need to be careful not to have someone who\u2019s overtly partisan.\u201d</p>\n<p>The other potential committee chairman who would oversee Tanden\u2019s hearings, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), chuckled when asked about Tanden on Monday, noting that she in the past has had a lot to say about him. He also declined to commit to hearings for her, saying only that he\u2019ll \u201ccross that bridge when we get there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) told reporters, \u201cI\u2019m not disqualifying anybody, but I do think it gets a lot harder obviously if they send someone from their progressive left that [is] kind of out of the mainstream.\u201d Mick Mulvaney, President Trump\u2019s first budget director, told Fox News that Tanden had very little chance of being confirmed.</p>\n<p>A loyal Democrat with decades of senior policymaking experience, Tanden has been tapped by Biden to lead the White House Office of Management and Budget, which plays a crucial role in setting the president\u2019s economic agenda and approving agency policies. She would be the first woman of color to lead the budget office.</p>\n<p>She is a close ally of former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and served as a senior adviser to President Barack Obama\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services, where she helped draft the Affordable Care Act. She is the president of the Center for American Progress (CAP), a left-leaning think tank with deep ties to Democratic policymakers. The OMB plays a pivotal role in the White House because of its work in setting the federal budget and clearing new regulations.</p>\n<p>Trump moves to strip job protections from White House budget analysts as he races to transform civil service</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be well-situated to play hard,\u201d said Dean Baker, a liberal economist. \u201cTanden is obviously an inside player, but she has been around Washington and will be smart on pushing stuff in ways that get through.\u201d</p>\n<p>If confirmed to lead the OMB, Tanden would be one of the central economic voices in the Biden administration, along with Janet Yellen, the former Federal Reserve chairwoman chosen to lead the Treasury Department; Cecilia Rouse, a Princeton economist tapped as head of the White House Council of Economic Advisers; and Brian Deese, a BlackRock investment executive named to lead the White House National Economic Council. All but Deese would require Senate confirmation.</p>\n<p>Sen. John Cornyn (Tex.), a member of the Senate GOP leadership, said he didn\u2019t see any reason he would oppose Yellen, but he said Tanden was Biden\u2019s \u201cworst nominee so far.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think, in light of her combative and insulting comments about many members of the Senate, mainly on our side of the aisle, that it creates certainly a problematic path,\u201d he said Monday.</p>\n<p>Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Republicans were being hypocritical, having brushed aside Trump\u2019s frequent Twitter attacks only to now express alarm about things Tanden has said in the past.</p>\n<p>\u201cHonestly, the hypocrisy is astounding,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Republicans are concerned about criticism on Twitter, their complaints are better directed at President Trump. I fully expect to see some crocodile tears spilled on the other side of the aisle over the president-elect\u2019s Cabinet nominees.\u201d</p>\n<p>Republicans currently hold a 50-to-48 majority in the Senate. The Georgia runoff elections for the two remaining seats in early January will determine which party controls the chamber when Biden takes office on Jan. 20.</p>\n<p>Tanden would be required to go through two separate confirmation hearings: one through the Budget Committee and the other through the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. The OMB is also a rare Cabinet position for which nominees have to submit their tax returns to the committees for review.</p>\n<p>How a 78-year-old mom became collateral damage in a messy fight between Sanders and Clinton supporters</p>\n<p>Tanden has a history of more pointed and partisan critiques of opponents than does Yellen, Deese or Rouse, feuding on Twitter with conservatives as well as supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).</p>\n<p>Her supporters praise her passion and willingness to fight aggressively across a range of policy issues, including her pushback against Republican deficit concerns at a time when many economists believe further stimulus spending is necessary to propel the economy.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need people with toughness. Neera has that,\u201d former congressman Barney Frank (D-Mass.) said. \u201cShe knows what she\u2019s doing. She understands the politics.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tanden\u2019s sometimes adversarial approach appears to strike a different tone than what Biden had promised during the campaign. In his victory speech, Biden called on Americans to \u201cput away the harsh rhetoric, lower the temperature, see each other again.\u201d He added: \u201cWe have to stop treating our opponents as our enemies. They are not our enemies.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tanden\u2019s comments may not be out of bounds within the climate of her party, however. Biden himself has also fiercely condemned Republicans at times. Under Tanden, CAP worked with the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank, on a series of events, including one that featured former Ohio governor John Kasich, a Republican at odds with Trump.</p>\n<p>Still, Tanden is likely to face the most difficult path to Senate confirmation of all Biden\u2019s picks so far, according to interviews with a half-dozen Republican aides and strategists, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal party deliberations.</p>\n<p>Tanden has also occasionally clashed with Sanders and his allies, with the senator attacking CAP over its reliance on corporate donations. The identities of these donors and whether they might have business before the OMB next year could be a source of scrutiny as Tanden navigates the Senate confirmation process. A think tank official said in an email that less than 2.5 percent of CAP\u2019s funding came from corporate sources and that its research frequently broke with the wishes of its donors.</p>\n<p>Briahna Joy Gray, a former Sanders spokeswoman, called Tanden\u2019s selection \u201cless of an olive branch than a middle finger to the left.\u201d But several prominent liberal lawmakers and economists, including Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), as well as Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), defended Tanden on Monday.</p>\n<p>Tanden declined to comment for this article. A spokesman for Sanders also declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Part of Tanden\u2019s appeal to Biden\u2019s team is her wide range of experience in leading CAP, which is one of the largest think tanks in Washington and deals with national security, domestic security and economic policy \u2014 all areas that the OMB director oversees, according to a person familiar with the transition. Biden\u2019s team is also expected to frequently highlight Tanden\u2019s hardscrabble upbringing, according to people close to the nomination process who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.</p>\n<p>A daughter of Indian immigrants, Tanden was raised by a single mother who relied on government assistance programs. Tanden later attended UCLA and Yale Law School.</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter my parents were divorced when I was young, my mother relied on public food and housing programs to get by,\u201d Tanden said on Twitter on Monday. \u201cNow, I\u2019m being nominated to help ensure those programs are secure, and ensure families like mine can live with dignity. I am beyond honored.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tanden held prominent policy positions in the administrations of Obama and Bill Clinton, and her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 was a factor in her selection to lead the OMB. She has denied playing a role in welfare reform under Clinton, which many Democrats now view as a disastrous mistake. At CAP, Tanden helped push the party left on budget and spending issues, although she \u2014 along with many other Washington liberals \u2014 at one time expressed openness to cutting Social Security and Medicare.</p>\n<p>In 2012, the think tank was riven by a debate over how aggressively to raise taxes on the rich in its official proposal for replacing the expiring George W. Bush tax cuts. Tanden pushed forcefully, and successfully, for the center to endorse a higher 39.6 percent top marginal bracket, according to multiple people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal the nature of the internal debate.</p>\n<p>Tanden also oversaw the creation of a liberal coalition group, called Hands Off, devoted to fighting Republican efforts to cut social programs such as food stamps. CAP helped spearhead the charge against many of the changes pushed through by Trump\u2019s budget office, including policies designed to make it harder for immigrants to secure government assistance and rules limiting government regulations. Her allies say that experience makes her almost uniquely well-suited to roll back many of the steps taken by the Trump administration.</p>\n<p>\u201cCAP has been at the center of most of the big fights through four years of Trump,\u201d said Lisa Gilbert, executive vice president of Public Citizen, a left-leaning policy group. \u201cThat speaks to someone coming in who knows what norms were broken \u2014 and where we will have to throw down.\u201d</p>"

Varon had found the man out of his hospital bed, crying and seeking help.</p>\n<p>The emotional moment was captured on Thanksgiving Day by photographer Go Nakamura, who was in the covid ward documenting the pandemic for Getty Images.</p>\n<p>The image circulated widely online over the weekend after Nakamura posted it on Facebook, resonating with the pain and struggle of millions of Americans, patients and health workers alike as the country reels from soaring coronavirus infections and hospitalizations.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am grateful to witness a wonderful moment and I thank all the medical staffs for their hard work even during the holiday season,\u201d Nakamura wrote on Facebook.</p>\n<p>The post has since been shared hundreds of times and prompted heartfelt reactions from users on social media.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am so glad the photo went viral because people are talking about what is really happening inside of hospitals,\u201d Nakamura told The Washington Post.</p>\n<p>\u201cI believe the photo can be the door to certain people so they can start to realize what is going on and what the reality is in the world right now,\u201d he said, referring to the skepticism about the severity of the coronavirus and the extent of the crisis that persists among many Americans.</p>\n<p>Nakamura was standing in the corner of the intensive care unit room when the encounter unfolded. He swiftly took his camera out and started shooting, trying to capture a moment that symbolized both the anguish and loneliness felt by so many patients separated from their loved ones for days on end, as well as the quiet, often unnoticed acts of compassion by medical workers.</p>\n<p>The photographer has visited the medical center more than 20 times and said he has witnessed many acts of generosity by Varon, whom he described as a \u201cwarm, big-hearted person,\u201d as well as his staff members.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was feeling sad, just like him, and I was just recollecting all the patients that I have had to do similar things with,\u201d Varon told CNN on Monday.</p>\n<p>\u201cI would go into their rooms, sit on their beds and chat with them because they truly need somebody,\u201d he said, adding that covid patients often cry and that some have even tried to escape the hospital, unable to bear the sting of isolation.</p>\n<p>The man depicted in the photograph is recovering and is expected to be discharged this week, Varon said.</p>\n<p>But with the surge of infections overwhelming hospitals across Texas, health workers at the United Memorial Medical Center are sometimes incapable of offering more comfort to their patients, Varon said.</p>\n<p>Last week, Texas reported the nation\u2019s second-highest number of infections in a single day, with 16,100 \u2014 about 1,000 more cases than a previous high. The state has reached more than 1,200,000 cases and more than 21,000 deaths, according to data gathered by The Post.</p>\n<p>Amid the surge, the strain on health workers and hospitals is growing as well, pushing many to their limits.</p>\n<p>Varon, who says he has worked for more than 250 days straight, has repeatedly warned about the severity of the crisis in the state and pleaded with people to acknowledge the danger of the virus and follow preventive measures such as social distancing and mask-wearing.</p>\n<p>But no relief seems to be on the horizon, with health workers and experts expecting an even bigger surge in cases following the holiday.</p>\n<p>Just a day before Thanksgiving, Varon sent a chilling warning in an interview with CNN. If people refuse \u201cto do the right thing,\u201d he said, \u201cAmerica will face the darkest days in modern American medical history.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nakamura\u2019s photograph offered a glimpse of what those days might look like.</p>"

                "body": "<p>Dressed in blue scrubs and carrying a stethoscope around her neck, an oncology nurse in Salem, Ore., looked to the Grinch as inspiration while suggesting that she ignored coronavirus guidelines outside of work.</p>\n<p>In a TikTok video posted Friday, she lip-dubbed a scene from \u201cHow the Grinch Stole Christmas\u201d to get her point across to her unaware colleagues: She does not wear a mask in public when she\u2019s not working at Salem Hospital.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen my co-workers find out I still travel, don\u2019t wear a mask when I\u2019m out and let my kids have play dates,\u201d the nurse wrote in a caption accompanying the video, which has since been deleted.</p>\n<p>Following swift online backlash from critics, her employer, Salem Health, announced Saturday that the nurse had been placed on administrative leave. In a statement, the hospital said the nurse, who has not been publicly identified by her employer, \u201cdisplayed cavalier disregard for the seriousness of this pandemic and her indifference towards physical distancing and masking out of work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe also want to assure you that this one careless statement does not reflect the position of Salem Health or the hardworking and dedicated caregivers who work here,\u201d said the hospital, adding that an investigation is underway.</p>\n<p>Salem Health did not respond to The Washington Post\u2019s request for comment as of early Monday.</p>\n<p>The nurse\u2019s video offers a startling and rare glimpse of a front-line health-care worker blatantly playing down a virus that has killed at least 266,000 Americans. It also has been seen in some coronavirus patients, some on their deathbeds, who still refuse to believe the pandemic is real.</p>\n<p>South Dakota nurse says many patients deny the coronavirus exists \u2014 right up until death</p>\n<p>The incident comes at a time when Oregon has continued to see a spike in new coronavirus cases and virus-related hospitalizations. Just last week, the state\u2019s daily reported deaths and hospitalizations rose by 33.3 and 24.2 percent respectively, according to The Post\u2019s coronavirus tracker. At least 74,120 Oregonians have been infected with the virus since late February; 905 of them have died.</p>\n<p>The clip posted to TikTok on Friday shows the nurse mocking the health guidelines while using audio from a scene in which the Grinch reveals his true identity to Cindy Lou Who.</p>\n<p>Although the original video was removed, TikTok users have shared a \u201cduet\u201d video posted by another user critical of the nurse, which had more than 274,000 reactions as of early Monday.</p>\n<p>Soon after she posted the clip, hundreds took to social media and the hospital\u2019s Facebook page to report the nurse\u2019s video and demand an official response from her employer. Some requested that the nurse be removed from her position and that her license be revoked.</p>\n<p>Hospital officials told the Salem Statesman Journal that the investigation is aiming to figure out which other staff members and patients have come in contact with the nurse, who works in the oncology department.</p>\n<p>Catch up on the biggest developments in the pandemic at the end of the day with our free coronavirus newsletter</p>\n<p>But for some, the hospital\u2019s apologies and actions were not enough.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe video supplied should be evidence enough,\" one Facebook user commented. \"She needs to be FIRED. Not on PAID leave. As someone fighting cancer, I can only imagine how her patients feel after seeing this news.\u201d</p>\n<p>The hospital thanked those who alerted them of the incident, emphasizing that its staff, patients and visitors must adhere to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese policies are strictly enforced among staff from the moment they leave their cars at work to the moment they start driving home,\u201d hospital officials told the Statesman Journal.</p>"

                "body": "<p>with Tonya Riley</p>\n<p>Christopher Krebs last night offered a cool, rational defense of the election\u2019s integrity in his first interview since President Trump fired him as the nation\u2019s top election security official.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was a stark contrast with President Trump, whose attacks on the 2020 contest are becoming increasingly fantastical.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Krebs, who led the government\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, gave \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interviewer Scott Pelley a point-by-point refutation of the unfounded election fraud claims made by Trump and his allies, which he called \u201cnonsense\u201d and \u201cfarcical.\u201d</p>\n<p>Those baseless claims include a conspiracy theory positing that Democrats operated a secret algorithm changing how machines recorded votes on an extensive scale and that votes were mysteriously tabulated overseas.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Krebs\u2019s bottom line: Such fraud claims fail the smell test because, as of 2020, there are paper records for 95 percent of ballots cast by American voters. And hand counts of those ballots in Georgia, Wisconsin and elsewhere show no significant difference between what was tabulated by machines.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe proof is in the ballots,\u201d he said. \u201cThe recounts are consistent with the initial count. To me that\u2019s further evidence, that\u2019s confirmation that the systems used in the 2020 election performed as expected and the American people should have 100 percent confidence in their votes.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s been a consistent message for Krebs, who has trumpeted the importance of paper ballots and post-election audits as vital protections against election hacking or other malfeasance for more than three years. Trump, by contrast, has \u00a0frequently shifted his claims about election fraud depending on where he thinks he can gain an edge.</p>\n<h5>Krebs lashed out at Rudy Giuliani and Trump\u2019s other lawyers who have peddled such claims.</h5>\n<p>He savaged a news conference in which the lawyers alleged without evidence that Dominion Voting Systems\u2019 machines somehow changed votes, calling it an attempt \u201cto undermine confidence in the election, to confuse people to scare people.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no evidence Dominion machines, which were used in Georgia and other states to mark and record votes, were compromised. Dominion has produced a 15-point refutation of the claims.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat it was actively doing was undermining democracy, and that\u2019s dangerous,\u201d Krebs said.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He also called it \u201ca travesty\u201d that doubts about the election\u2019s integrity have led to attacks, including death threats, against secretaries of state and other election officials.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re defending democracy. They\u2019re doing their jobs,\u201d he said.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Here are more details from Krebs's interview from Jaclyn Peiser.\u00a0</p>\n<h5>Trump, meanwhile, doubled down on his baseless claims.\u00a0</h5>\n<p>In his first TV interview since the election, he casually suggested to Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d host Maria Bartiromo that the Justice Department and the FBI might have been part of a broad conspiracy to rig the election.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He also repeated debunked claims, including that large numbers of ballots were cast on behalf of the deceased, and pledged he was \u201cgoing to use 125 percent of my energy\u201d to continue to contest President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s win, Felicia Sonmez reports.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Trump claimed that foreign leaders have been calling and telling him this was the most \u201cmessed-up\u201d election they have ever seen, but he did not name any of the leaders.</p>\n<h5>The president also lashed out after Krebs\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview.\u00a0</h5>\n<p>He tweeted, calling U.S. election security \u201can international joke\u201d and describing the 2020 election as \u201cprobably our least secure EVER!\u201d</p>\n<p>In another tweet, Trump promised \u201csome big things happening in our various litigations on the Election Hoax. Everybody knows it was Rigged.\u201d</p>\n<p>Twitter flagged both tweets as containing \u201cdisputed\u201d claims.</p>\n<p>The president\u2019s apparent concern about election security is undermined by the fact he held only one Cabinet-level meeting on election security during his presidency. He also did not endorse Democratic-led efforts to increase funding to further secure voting such as paper ballots and post-election audits.\u00a0</p>\n<h5>But Trump\u2019s legal paths to reversing Biden\u2019s win are fast vanishing.\u00a0</h5>\n<p>Wisconsin completed a recount in its two largest counties that reconfirmed Biden\u2019s victory in the state, and Pennsylvania\u2019s Supreme Court dismissed with prejudice an effort to invalidate Biden\u2019s win in that state.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Observers are also warning an effort to invalidate Biden\u2019s win in Georgia could dissuade Republicans from voting in upcoming runoffs to determine control of the Senate.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That case was brought by Trump ally Sidney Powell, who claims without evidence the Dominion voting system used in the state was corrupted in a widespread conspiracy that included Georgia\u2019s Gov. Brian Kemp (R) and Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who has defended the integrity of the state\u2019s election results.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Trump\u2019s official legal team, led by Giuliani, has distanced itself from Powell and the suit, but Trump has tweeted approvingly about the case. He has also frequently repeated the Dominion conspiracy theory and suggested Georgians\u2019 votes in the runoff won\u2019t be tallied accurately.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s David Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research:</p>\n<p>And my colleague Amy Gardner:</p>\n<p>Sens. David Perdue (R-Ga.) and Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.), who are defending their seats in those runoffs, have both called for Raffensperger\u2019s resignation, citing \u201cmismanagement\u00a0and lack of transparency,\u201d but they haven\u2019t specifically described what\u00a0Raffensperger did wrong.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Krebs singled out Raffensperger in his \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview, praising him for \u201cputting country before party.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<h3>The keys</h3>\n<h5>The Supreme Court will hear arguments today in a case that could significantly limit the nation\u2019s main anti-hacking law.</h5>\n<p>If the justices rein in\u00a0the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, that would be a huge win for ethical hackers who say the broad interpretations of the law frequently limit legitimate cybersecurity research.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As it\u2019s currently interpreted, the law makes it a crime to violate a website or product\u2019s terms of service. Critics say that gives companies far too much leeway to threaten researchers who search for bugs in their products with civil lawsuits or criminal prosecution.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The court will review the case of a former Georgia police officer convicted in 2017 under the law for allegedly selling information from a police database. Critics say lower courts interpreted the law too broadly because the officer didn\u2019t hack into the database. He just misused his legitimate access to it.</p>\n<h5>Suspected North Korean hackers attempted to steal research from coronavirus vaccine developer AstraZeneca.\u00a0\u00a0</h5>\n<p>The hackers don\u2019t appear to have been successful, sources with knowledge of the matter told Jack Stubbs at Reuters. It\u2019s the latest in a string of alleged attacks by government-backed hacking groups against researchers and drugmakers working on a vaccine.</p>\n<p>The hackers posed as recruiters offering jobs to employees of the British pharmaceutical company.\u00a0The group\u2019s tools and techniques resemble those U.S. officials have attributed to North Korean hackers, officials told Stubbs. Microsoft also recently identified attempts by North Korean hacking groups to steal coronavirus research in multiple countries.\u00a0</p>\n<h5>Baltimore County schools failed to safeguard sensitive information before a devastating ransomware attack.</h5>\n<p>The ransomware attack will prevent the school district from offering distance classes for its 115,000 students through at least Tuesday, school officials announced.</p>\n<p>Police are investigating the attack, which first knocked the county\u2019s school systems offline on Wednesday. It\u2019s unclear whether the \u201csignificant risks\u201d detailed in a state audit released the day before the attack contributed to the hacker\u2019s success, Alison Knezevich at the Baltimore Sun reported.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The audit found that the school system lacked a system for detecting \u201cuntrusted traffic.\u201d The audit also found that the school system failed to adequately isolate its publicly available servers from its internal network, exposing it to increased risk.</p>\n<p>Baltimore's city IT system was devastated last year by a ransomware attack.\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Transition news</h3>\n<h5>Biden will nominate Neera Tanden to be director of the White House Office of Management and Budget.\u00a0</h5>\n<p>Tanden is currently chief executive of the left-leaning Center for American Progress think tank. If confirmed, she would have a hand in setting telecommunications and cybersecurity policy for federal agencies. Tanden would be the first woman of color to serve in the role, Annie Linskey and Jeff Stein report.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tanden is no stranger to hacking scandals. Her personal correspondence with Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta, was revealed in hacked emails posted by WikiLeaks during the 2016 election.</p>\n<h3>Cyber insecurity</h3>\n<h5>British officials are investigating a cyberattack against the Manchester United soccer team.\u00a0\u00a0</h5>\n<p>The United Kingdom\u2019s top cybersecurity agency is working with the team to secure its network before switching it back online, Jamie Jackson at the Guardian reports.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The incident has made email and some other internal systems unavailable.

                "body": "<p>COVINGTON, Ga. \u2014 Not long ago, Elizabeth Allen and Wanda Cummings were on the same side of America\u2019s political divide.</p>\n<p>Both were reliable Republican voters in a reliably conservative part of a reliably red state. But Cummings and Allen have changed, and so has their state, Georgia. They just haven\u2019t changed in the same way.</p>\n<p>Allen, a nurse, grew up idolizing Ronald Reagan but couldn\u2019t stomach President Trump\u2019s disregard for facts or civility. When she cast a vote for Joe Biden this year \u2014 helping him to swell his margins in the fast-growing suburbs of Newton County and claim Georgia\u2019s 16 electoral votes \u2014 it was the first time she had ever marked a ballot for a Democrat.</p>\n<p>Cummings, a retired antique store owner, moved from Newton and found ideological kinship just across the county line, in rural and ever-redder Jasper. She reluctantly backed Trump in 2016. But after his four years in office, she \u2014 and her new county \u2014 turned out for the president with gusto.</p>\n<p>Allen and Cummings crossed lines that in America today increasingly resemble a chasm. Unlike some previous elections marked by either a blue or a red wave, the 2020 vote featured both. And in many parts of the country, they crested side-by-side, with the turnout and margin for Trump surging next door to areas that boomed for Biden.</p>\n<p>The boundary between Newton and Jasper counties \u2014 amid pine forests and cow pastures southeast of Atlanta \u2014 is one such place. How it evolves will help determine whether Georgia stays blue in future presidential contests and, more immediately, whether Democrats can take control of the Senate via a pair of runoff elections in January.</p>\n<p>The widening gulf between Newton and Jasper \u2014 as is true with the divide nationally \u2014 has many features, but can be summarized in three words: diversity, diplomas and density.</p>\n<p>On one side, Newton is a fast-developing, multicultural county with sprawling housing developments, an increasingly educated population and Hollywood and Silicon Valley buoying the local economy. The Confederate monument that has loomed over the county\u2019s central square for more than a century is on its way out.</p>\n<p>On the other, Jasper is a predominantly White county that has retained far more of its traditional character, with large housing lots, farms and wide-open vistas dominating a landscape that feels further from Atlanta than the 60 miles shown on maps. Here, the Confederate monument will stay \u2014 at least for now.</p>\n<p> [Confederate monuments are falling, but hundreds still stand. Here\u2019s where.] </p>\n<p>For residents and visitors alike, the differences are stark.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you cross over the line,\u201d said Cummings, \u201cyou cross over into a whole other country.\u201d</p>\n<p>That the division exists at all is a relatively new phenomenon, and it reflects the transformation underway in Georgia that enabled Biden to win in a state that had not been carried by a Democrat in nearly 30 years.</p>\n<p>Both counties have traditionally been rural emblems of the Old South, their picturesque central squares dominated by clock-tower-topped courthouses. Newton was the real-life backdrop to the \u201cDukes of Hazzard\u201d and \u201cIn the Heat of the Night.\u201d Locals say either of the counties\u2019 two main cities \u2014 Covington in Newton, Monticello in Jasper \u2014 could be mistaken for Mayberry.</p>\n<p>But Newton has, with time, become more integrated into metro Atlanta. Workers commute into the city \u2014 just over 30 minutes from Covington to downtown \u2014 and city residents have moved out to Newton in search of more land at lower prices.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe county has changed a lot,\u201d said Cedrick Hamm, the third generation of his family to operate the Town House Cafe, a Black-owned Covington staple since 1965. \u201cYou can\u2019t find houses out here anymore. They\u2019ve all been bought up.\u201d</p>\n<p>The change has had a pronounced political impact.</p>\n<p>As recently as 2004, both Newton and Jasper voted overwhelmingly for the Republican, George W. Bush, in the presidential race.</p>\n<p>Four years later, the counties began to diverge politically: Jasper voted 2 to 1 for John McCain, while Newton went for Barack Obama by the barest of margins, just over 1 percent.</p>\n<p>Since then, the disparity has only grown. In 2020, amid record-breaking turnout, Biden won Newton County by 11 points. Trump won Jasper by 53.</p>\n<p>The political gap reflects a pronounced demographic difference: Newton is about three-quarters the size of Jasper, but it has a population that is 10 times as large. It is wealthier \u2014 attracting tech investments as well as directors looking to shoot their latest film \u2014 and has twice the percentage of residents with a college degree. It is also majority minority, while Jasper remains nearly 80 percent White.</p>\n<p>Cummings had lived in Newton for 20 years. But when her husband fell ill in 2018, she closed the family antique store and moved to Jasper, a place where political beliefs and values better aligned with her own. It\u2019s become a well-worn path for former Newton residents \u2014 many of them White \u2014 who have decided the county is no longer for them and prefer to be farther from the city.</p>\n<p>\u201cNewton County has gotten to be a suburb of Atlanta,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cJasper County\u2019s not. It\u2019s still just very laid back and quiet.\u201d</p>\n<p>She had voted for Trump in 2016 as \u201cthe lesser of two evils.\u201d Four years later, her feelings were very different. \u201cI thoroughly enjoyed him as president,\u201d said Cummings, who approvingly described him as acting \u201clike he\u2019s a regular guy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Back in Newton, Allen was having the opposite experience. A lifelong Republican who learned to revere Reagan from her World War II-veteran grandfather, she couldn\u2019t bring herself to vote for Trump in 2016, especially after he mocked people with disabilities. But Allen, whose youngest son has special needs, couldn\u2019t imagine voting for a Democrat, either.</p>\n<p>This year, the 44-year-old cast her ballot for Biden, a vote she said was equal parts repudiation of Trump and endorsement of the Democrat.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying he\u2019s perfect,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he\u2019s a good man. He kind of reminds me of John McCain.\u201d</p>\n<p>Allen can trace her family\u2019s history in Newton back five generations, a legacy highlighted by both farmers and soldiers.</p>\n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t asked which side we were on during the Civil War,\u201d she said. \u201cProbably the wrong side.\u201d</p>\n<p>But when a movement erupted this summer to banish Newton\u2019s Confederate monument from Covington\u2019s central square, following the killing of George Floyd, she was all for it.</p>\n<p>Allen, who has seen firsthand the toll of the coronavirus from her post as an emergency room nurse, used to be active in the local Republican Party.</p>\n<p>But her change of political heart has cost her friendships. As former allies have spun theories about voter fraud, she has piped up on social media to set the record straight.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey blocked me on Facebook because I was giving facts,\u201d she said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t seem to like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>It is just that sort of political vitriol that Ryan Barrett saw feeding support for Biden as he spoke with voters across Newton in the campaign\u2019s final weeks.</p>\n<p>The 33-year-old head of the Newton County Democrats said his side was energized by the country\u2019s cumulative exhaustion. After four years of chaos under Trump, \u201cpeople just wanted things to get back to normal,\u201d said Barrett, an emergency room technician when not practicing politics. \u201cPeople were tired of it. They were tired of the \u2018Jerry Springer Show.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p>Not so in Jasper. Along the county\u2019s 300 miles of dirt roads \u2014 not to mention its paved ones \u2014 Make America Great Again flags and signs were ubiquitous, even weeks after the vote. In a county won by Trump by a 3-to-1 margin, it could be hard to find people who did not want four more years.</p>\n<p>\u201cEverybody was pretty happy,\u201d said Mary Patrick, chair of the Jasper Republicans. \u201cLike it or not, Trump is very popular. You don\u2019t have somebody have rallies with 30,000 people or even 10,000 people if they\u2019re not popular.\u201d</p>\n<p>Patrick helped to organize get-out-the-vote efforts for the president in Jasper, and found success: In a county of only about 14,000 people, Trump won 1,400 more votes than he had in 2016.</p>\n<p>But those results \u2014 and others like them across rural Georgia \u2014 were canceled out, and more, by what happened in the cities and suburbs.</p>\n<p> [In Georgia, get-out-the-vote operations that helped Biden win haven\u2019t stopped] </p>\n<p>In Newton, about 8,000 voters turned out for Biden beyond the number that backed Hillary Clinton in 2016. The surge stemmed from a concerted voter registration drive launched statewide by former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, said Barrett, a veteran of her campaign.</p>\n<p>\u201cEach side dug deeper into their base,\u201d said Emory University political science professor Andra Gillespie. \u201cIt just so happens that Democrats have the growing base.\u201d</p>\n<p>With Georgia\u2019s population becoming more diverse, more urban and better educated, there are reasons to think that, with time, Jasper will start to resemble Newton. The first test will come in January, when Trump will no longer be on the ballot \u2014 but two Senate seats and control of the upper chamber will be.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis whole state is going to get more Democratic,\u201d said Hamm, whose down-home cafe is a magnet for local politicians of all stripes. \u201cNewton County is just ahead of the state.\u201d</p>\n<p>That is what Patrick, the GOP leader in Jasper, fears, as newcomers priced out of the market closer to Atlanta make their way to her county.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll we can do here in Jasper is make sure that we try to keep it red and that the people moving here aren\u2019t going to try and turn it blue,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019ll be a big challenge.\u201d</p>\n<p>For now, at least, that sort of transformation seems a distant prospect.</p>\n<p>Bryan Standifer, the first Black mayor of Monticello, backed Biden enthusiastically. But few among his White neighbors in Jasper did the same.</p>\n<p>The president, Standifer said, had played on racism and other divisive tactics to win a \u201ccultlike following\u201d that has made it difficult for Black and White residents of Jasper to talk politics with one another. That, he said, isn\u2019t going away, even when Trump is no longer president.</p>\n<p>\u201cJoe Biden got the most votes of any elected president in U.S. history,\u201d Standifer said. \u201cBut guess who got the second most? Trump. That tells you there\u2019s still a lot of division.\u201d</p>\n<p>Willis reported from Covington and Monticello. Witte reported from Washington.</p>"

                "body": "<p>WASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department asked a federal judge on Monday to dismiss the criminal case against President Trump\u2019s former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn, citing his pardon last week \u2014 and making clear that it broadly covered potential legal troubles beyond the charge Mr. Flynn had faced of lying to federal investigators.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe president\u2019s pardon, which General Flynn has accepted, moots this case,\u201d the Justice Department filing said.</p>\n<p>Mr. Flynn had twice pleaded guilty to a charge of lying to the F.B.I. about his conversations in late 2016, during the Trump presidential transition, with the Russian ambassador to the United States. His original plea deal also covered legal liability for other potential charges related to his work as an unregistered foreign agent of Turkey in 2016.</p>\n<p>But Mr. Flynn \u2014 whose case became a cause for Mr. Trump and his supporters as they attacked the Trump-Russia investigation led by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III \u2014 sought to change his plea to not guilty. And Attorney General William P. Barr asked the judge, Emmet G. Sullivan of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, to dismiss the case in a highly unusual about-face for the Justice Department.</p>\n<p>But the judge instead began a review of the request\u2019s legitimacy, appointing an outside critic \u2014 John Gleeson, a former federal judge and mafia prosecutor \u2014 who portrayed Mr. Barr\u2019s move as a lawless abuse of power to show special favor to a presidential ally, and urged Judge Sullivan to instead proceed to sentencing Mr. Flynn.</p>\n<p>Last week, with Judge Sullivan yet to issue any ruling, Mr. Trump instead pardoned his former aide, taking political responsibility for ending the case. As a result, the Justice Department said in a new filing, the entire matter is moot.</p>\n<p>The filing was accompanied by the text of the pardon itself, which had not previously been released. While Mr. Trump had said on Twitter that he was granting Mr. Flynn a \u201cfull\u201d pardon, he left unclear how far that would go in terms of any potential legal jeopardy for Mr. Flynn over other matters for which he had not been charged.</p>\n<p>The pardon, however, was written broadly not only to cover lying to the F.B.I., but to foreclose any legal jeopardy Mr. Flynn might face from a future Justice Department arising from the Turkey matter, his inconsistent statements under oath to Judge Sullivan and any potential perjury or false statements to Mr. Mueller\u2019s team or to the grand juries it used.</p>\n<p>In a three-page filing accompanying the pardon, the Justice Department emphasized to Judge Sullivan that the language covered \u201cany possible future perjury or contempt charge in connection with General Flynn\u2019s sworn statements and any other possible future charge\u201d that the judge or Mr. Gleeson \u201chas suggested might somehow keep this criminal case alive over the government\u2019s objection.\u201d</p>\n<p>Judge Sullivan did not immediately file a response to the new motion to dismiss, and Mr. Gleeson did not respond to an email requesting comment.</p>\n<p>Andrew Weissmann, a former member of the special counsel team who was not directly involved in prosecuting Mr. Flynn, condemned the Trump administration\u2019s handling of the case after Mr. Mueller\u2019s office shut down.</p>\n<p>\u201cTrump issued the pardon only after Barr debased the Department of Justice by filing a disingenuous motion to dismiss,\u201d Mr. Weissmann said. \u201cSullivan will have the opportunity to weigh in on his view of all this when he grants the motion to dismiss based on the full pardon.\u201d</p>\n<p>But the Justice Department filing signaled that under the Trump administration, at least, the Flynn matter is closed.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo further proceedings are necessary or appropriate, as the court must immediately dismiss the case with prejudice,\u201d it said.</p>"

Andrew Cuomo\u2019s professional public health staff. In its 5-to-4 decision the court rejected Mr. Cuomo\u2019s restrictions on the number of worshipers in a church or synagogue in areas of New York designated as red or orange zones, reflecting their high positivity count for Covid-19.</p>\n<p>The last time I checked, there were no public health professionals serving on the Supreme Court.

I mean, instead, that he\u2019ll be the first modern U.S. president trying to govern in the face of an opposition that refuses to accept his legitimacy. And no, Democrats never said Donald Trump was illegitimate, just that he was incompetent and dangerous.</p>\n<p>It goes without saying that Donald Trump, whose conspiracy theories are getting wilder and wilder, will never concede, and that millions of his followers will always believe \u2014 or at least say they believe \u2014 that the election was stolen.</p>\n<p>Most Republicans in Congress certainly know this is a lie, although even on Capitol Hill there are a lot more crazy than we\u2019d like to imagine. But it doesn\u2019t matter; they still won\u2019t accept that Biden has any legitimacy, even though he won the popular vote by a large margin.</p>\n<p>And this won\u2019t simply be because they fear a backlash from the base if they admit that Trump lost fair and square. At a fundamental level \u2014 and completely separate from the Trump factor \u2014 today\u2019s G.O.P. doesn\u2019t believe that Democrats ever have the right to govern, no matter how many votes they receive.</p>\n<p>After all, in recent years we\u2019ve seen what happens when a state with a Republican legislature elects a Democratic governor: Legislators quickly try to strip away the governor\u2019s powers. So does anyone doubt that Republicans will do all they can to hobble and sabotage Biden\u2019s presidency?</p>\n<p>The only real questions are how much harm the G.O.P. can do, and how Biden will respond.</p>\n<p>The answer to the first question depends a lot on what happens in the Jan. 5 Georgia Senate runoffs. If Democrats win both seats, they\u2019ll have effective though narrow control of both houses of Congress. If they don\u2019t, Mitch McConnell will have enormous powers of obstruction \u2014 and anyone who doubts that he\u2019ll use those powers to undermine Biden at every turn is living in a fantasy world.</p>\n<p>But how much damage would obstructionism inflict? In terms of economic policy \u2014 which is all I\u2019ll talk about in this column \u2014 the near future can be divided into two eras, pre- and post-vaccine (or more accurately, after wide dissemination of a vaccine).</p>\n<p>For the next few months, as the pandemic continues to run wild, tens of millions of Americans will be in desperate straits unless the federal government steps up to help. Unfortunately, Republicans may be in a position to block this help.</p>\n<p>The good news about the very near future, such as it is, is that Americans will probably (and correctly) blame Donald Trump, not Joe Biden, for the misery they\u2019re experiencing \u2014 and this very fact may make Republicans willing to cough up at least some money.</p>\n<p>What about the post-vaccine economy? Here again there\u2019s potentially some good news: Once a vaccine becomes widely available, we\u2019ll probably see a spontaneous economic recovery, one that won\u2019t depend on Republican cooperation. And there will also be a vast national sense of relief.</p>\n<p>So Biden might do OK for a while even in the face of scorched-earth Republican opposition. But we can\u2019t be sure of that. Republicans might refuse to confirm anyone for key economic positions. There\u2019s always the possibility of another financial crisis \u2014 and outgoing Trump officials have been systematically undermining the incoming administration\u2019s ability to deal with such a crisis if it happens. And America desperately needs action on issues from infrastructure, to climate change, to tax enforcement that won\u2019t happen if Republicans retain blocking power.</p>\n<p>So what can Biden do?</p>\n<p>First, he needs to start talking about immediate policy actions to help ordinary Americans, if only to make it clear to Georgia voters how much damage will be done if they don\u2019t elect Democrats to those two Senate seats.</p>\n<p>If Democrats don\u2019t get those seats, Biden will need to use executive action to accomplish as much as possible despite Republican obstruction \u2014 although I worry that the Trump-stacked Supreme Court will try to block him when he does.</p>\n<p>Finally, although Biden is still talking in a comforting way about unity and reaching across the aisle, at some point he\u2019ll need to stop reassuring us that he\u2019s nothing like Trump and start making Republicans pay a political price for their attempts to prevent him from governing.</p>\n<p>Now, I don\u2019t mean that he should sound like Trump, demanding retribution against his enemies \u2014 although the Justice Department should be allowed to do its job and prosecute whatever Trump-era crimes it finds.</p>\n<p>No, what Biden needs to do is what Harry Truman did in 1948, when he built political support by running against \u201cdo-nothing\u201d Republicans. And he\u2019ll have a better case than Truman ever did, because today\u2019s Republicans are infinitely more corrupt and less patriotic than the Republicans Truman faced.</p>\n<p>The results of this year\u2019s election, with a solid Biden win but Republicans doing well down-ballot, tells us that American voters don\u2019t fully understand what the modern G.O.P. is really about. Biden needs to get that point across, and make Republicans pay for the sabotage we all know is coming.</p>\n<p>The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

                "byline": "By Jochen Bittner",
                "body": "<p>HAMBURG, Germany \u2014 It may well be that Germans have a special inclination to panic at specters from the past, and I admit that this alarmism annoys me at times. Yet watching President Trump\u2019s \u201cStop the Steal\u201d campaign since Election Day, I can\u2019t help but see a parallel to one of the most dreadful episodes from Germany\u2019s history.</p>\n<p>One hundred years ago, amid the implosions of Imperial Germany, powerful conservatives who led the country into war refused to accept that they had lost. Their denial gave birth to arguably the most potent and disastrous political lie of the 20th century \u2014 the Dolchstosslegende, or stab-in-the-back myth.</p>\n<p>Its core claim was that Imperial Germany never lost World War I. Defeat, its proponents said, was declared but not warranted. It was a conspiracy, a con, a capitulation \u2014 a grave betrayal that forever stained the nation. That the claim was palpably false didn\u2019t matter. Among a sizable number of Germans, it stirred resentment, humiliation and anger. And the one figure who knew best how to exploit their frustration was Adolf Hitler.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t get me wrong: This is not about comparing Mr. Trump to Hitler, which would be absurd. But the Dolchstosslegende provides a warning. It\u2019s tempting to dismiss Mr. Trump\u2019s irrational claim that the election was \u201crigged\u201d as a laughable last convulsion of his reign or a cynical bid to heighten the market value for the TV personality he might once again intend to become, especially as he appears to be giving up on his effort to overturn the election result.</p>\n<p>But that would be a grave error. Instead, the campaign should be seen as what it is: an attempt to elevate \u201cThey stole it\u201d to the level of legend, perhaps seeding for the future social polarization and division on a scale America has never seen.</p>\n<p>In 1918, Germany was staring at defeat. The entry of the United States into the war the year before, and a sequence of successful counterattacks by British and French forces, left German forces demoralized. Navy sailors went on strike. They had no appetite to be butchered in the hopeless yet supposedly holy mission of Kaiser Wilhelm II and the loyal aristocrats who made up the Supreme Army Command.</p>\n<p>A starving population joined the strikes and demands for a republic grew. On Nov. 9, 1918, Wilhelm abdicated, and two days later the army leaders signed the armistice. It was too much to bear for many: Military officers, monarchists and right-wingers spread the myth that if it had not been for political sabotage by Social Democrats and Jews back home, the army would never have had to give in.</p>\n<p>The deceit found willing supporters. \u201cIm Felde unbesiegt\u201d \u2014 \u201cundefeated on the battlefield\u201d \u2014 was the slogan with which returning soldiers were greeted. Newspapers and postcards depicted German soldiers being stabbed in the back by either evil figures carrying the red flag of socialism or grossly caricatured Jews.</p>\n<p>By the time of the Treaty of Versailles the following year, the myth was already well established. The harsh conditions imposed by the Allies, including painful reparation payments, burnished the sense of betrayal. It was especially incomprehensible that Germany, in just a couple of years, had gone from one of the world\u2019s most respected nations to its biggest loser.</p>\n<p>The startling aspect about the Dolchstosslegende is this: It did not grow weaker after 1918 but stronger. In the face of humiliation and unable or unwilling to cope with the truth, many Germans embarked on a disastrous self-delusion: The nation had been betrayed, but its honor and greatness could never be lost. And those without a sense of national duty and righteousness \u2014 the left and even the elected government of the new republic \u2014 could never be legitimate custodians of the country.</p>\n<p>In this way, the myth was not just the sharp wedge that drove the Weimar Republic apart. It was also at the heart of Nazi propaganda, and instrumental in justifying violence against opponents. The key to Hitler\u2019s success was that, by 1933, a considerable part of the German electorate had put the ideas embodied in the myth \u2014 honor, greatness, national pride \u2014 above democracy.</p>\n<p>The Germans were so worn down by the lost war, unemployment and international humiliation that they fell prey to the promises of a \u201cF\u00fchrer\u201d who cracked down hard on anyone perceived as \u201ctraitors,\u201d leftists and Jews above all. The stab-in-the-back myth was central to it all. When Hitler became chancellor on Jan. 30, 1933, the Nazi newspaper V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter wrote that \u201cirrepressible pride goes through the millions\u201d who fought so long to \u201cundo the shame of 9 November 1918.\u201d</p>\n<p>Germany\u2019s first democracy fell. Without a basic consensus built on a shared reality, society split into groups of ardent, uncompromising partisans. And in an atmosphere of mistrust and paranoia, the notion that dissenters were threats to the nation steadily took hold.</p>\n<p>Alarmingly, that seems to be exactly what is happening in the United States today. According to the Pew Research Center, 89 percent of Trump supporters believe that a Joe Biden presidency would do \u201clasting harm to the U.S.,\u201d while 90 percent of Biden supporters think the reverse. And while the question of which news media to trust has long split America, now even the largely unmoderated Twitter is regarded as partisan. Since the election, millions of Trump supporters have installed the alternative social media app Parler. Filter bubbles are turning into filter networks.</p>\n<p>In such a landscape of social fragmentation, Mr. Trump\u2019s baseless accusations about electoral fraud could do serious harm. A staggering 88 percent of Trump voters believe that the election result is illegitimate, according to a YouGov poll. A myth of betrayal and injustice is well underway.</p>\n<p>It took another war and decades of reappraisal for the Dolchstosslegende to be exposed as a disastrous, fatal fallacy. If it has any worth today, it is in the lessons it can teach other nations.

                "body": "<p>For years, the stalemate in Afghanistan has left American officials torn between two bad options: Prop up a corrupt, hopelessly divided Afghan government indefinitely or admit defeat and go home, leaving the country to its fate. At 19 years and counting, the U.S.-led effort in Afghanistan is already the longest war in American history. A consensus has been forming that it is time for U.S. troops to come home. But the speed of the withdrawal and whether any residual force will be left behind to carry out counterterrorism operations remain open questions.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration has taken laudable steps toward a U.S. exit. In February, it struck a deal with the Taliban to withdraw American forces from the country within 14 months. In exchange, the Taliban agreed to cut ties with Al Qaeda, prevent terrorists from using Afghanistan as a base for international attacks, help reduce violence and participate in talks with Afghanistan\u2019s political leadership to try to end the conflict.</p>\n<p>American diplomats have been pressing the Taliban to live up to their end of the bargain. Qaeda fighters are still believed to be embedded with the Taliban, although Al Qaeda\u2019s leader, Ayman al-Zawahri, may now be dead, according to Pakistani media. Intra-Afghan peace talks began in Doha, the capital of Qatar, in September but have stalled over a fresh wave of attacks and uncertainty over whether the Biden administration will honor the deal with the Taliban. Over the weekend, the Taliban announced on social media that both sides had agreed to a set of guiding principles for the talks, but President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan has reportedly pushed back on that claim, denying that an agreement has been reached.</p>\n<p>The two sides have yet to begin confronting a host of seemingly irreconcilable differences, including whether to be a theocracy or a republic, and the status of women and followers of the Shiite sect of Islam. The Taliban claim that they now accept Shiites as fellow Muslims. But previously Taliban leaders have justified persecuting them as infidels. In 1998, Taliban commanders massacred thousands of Hazaras, an ethnic minority that predominantly follows Shiite Islam, when they took power in their region. Today, two commanders of that bloody operation are among the Taliban negotiators in Doha. Some Hazaras fear the Taliban are simply going through the motions of peace talks until U.S. forces leave.</p>\n<p>Efforts to hold the Taliban accountable for their commitments have been undercut by the Trump administration\u2019s abrupt announcement that it will pull all but 2,500 American troops out of the country by Jan. 15, regardless of whether the conditions the Taliban agreed to have been met. President Trump, who spent Thanksgiving 2019 with U.S. soldiers at Bagram Airfield, wants to keep a promise to bring American soldiers home before he leaves office. But NATO\u2019s secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, expressed alarm at Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement and said the alliance would continue to train Afghan security forces even with the planned U.S. reductions. NATO has 12,000 personnel in the country, about half of whom are often American troops, and relies heavily on the U.S. military for transportation and logistics.</p>\n<p>President-elect Joe Biden is unlikely to depart radically from the Trump administration\u2019s exit plan. Mr. Biden opposed the Obama-era surge in Afghanistan and wrote in the spring in Foreign Affairs magazine that \u201cit is past time to end the forever wars.\u201d</p>\n<p>But an American withdrawal does not have to mean ending financial support for the Afghan people or leaving the region in chaos. The United States has a moral obligation to work with regional partners to try to clean up the mess we are leaving behind.</p>\n<p>Americans have the geopolitical luxury of flying away from a war they plunged into in 2001 in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Afghanistan\u2019s neighbors do not. Six countries share a border with Afghanistan. Not one wants a failed state on its doorstep. Afghanistan has been at war almost continuously since 1978, partly because its powerful neighbors have all tried to manage the chaos inside it by funding proxies. A debilitating free-for-all might be prevented if Afghanistan\u2019s neighbors work together to support a peace process.</p>\n<p>This is a rare instance where Iran, Russia, China, Pakistan and the United States all share a common interest: the orderly departure of American troops and preventing Afghanistan from imploding.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump, who has a well-known allergy to multilateral cooperation and a zero-sum mentality toward Iran and China, has been unable to fully engage Afghanistan\u2019s neighbors in the effort to stabilize the country. In March 2019, American diplomats threatened to veto the U.N. Security Council resolution renewing the mandate of the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan because it referred to China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative.

While it is far from clear that Afghan talks can negotiate a political settlement that will end the war between the Taliban and the Afghan government, a coordinated regional approach is more likely to produce success than a rapid unilateral American withdrawal. American soldiers should not be held hostage to a peace agreement that might never come. But with U.S. troops down to 2,500 soldiers, some portion of which is needed as a security umbrella for the embassy, the costs of the U.S. effort in Afghanistan have fallen sharply.

                "subheadline": "For two centuries, census totals used to apportion Congress have included all residents. The Supreme Court on Monday heard the Trump administration\u2019s argument for only counting citizens.",
                "byline": "By Michael Wines",
                "body": "<p>On Monday, the Supreme Court heard arguments on a question that goes to the heart of American democracy: Must the government count everyone living in the country, citizens or not, in the census totals that the House of Representatives uses to reallocate its 435 seats among the states?</p>\n<p>For more than two centuries, the answer has been \u201cyes.\u201d Both Article 1 of the Constitution and the 14th Amendment require that House seats be allotted according to \u201cthe whole number\u201d of persons in each state. That phrase has long been read to include all the nation\u2019s residents, whether American citizens, foreigners admitted here on visas or immigrants with no documents at all. But President Trump signaled in a memorandum this summer that he intended to exclude unauthorized immigrants from the 2020 census totals that he hoped to send to the House next year for use in reapportionment.</p>\n<p>Federal courts have ruled in three separate lawsuits that Mr. Trump lacks that authority, saying in one case that the question was not even close. But the Supreme Court will have the final say. Here\u2019s a rundown of some of the basics behind the issue:</p>\n<h2>What\u2019s at stake in the case?</h2>\n<p>First and foremost, the allocation of political power. No precise count of unauthorized immigrants exists. Mr. Trump has ordered the Census Bureau to come up with an estimate, but many experts put the number at about 11 million.</p>\n<p>Many are concentrated in states with large immigrant populations, such as New York and Texas, and in states like California and Florida where undocumented immigrants also are in demand for farm work. Some of those states and a few others could lose House seats if unauthorized immigrants were excluded from census totals.</p>\n<p>Conversely, some states with few unauthorized immigrants could pick up those seats. Alabama, for example, appears set to lose one of its seven House seats in the next reapportionment; the state is arguing in a separate lawsuit that undocumented immigrants are illegally depriving its citizens of fair representation. Many experts feel that restricting the count to citizens would tend to benefit states that are rural and Republican at the expense of ones that are urban and Democratic. But the Republican Party\u2019s gains probably would be small, most say, given that big Republican states like Texas would be among those that could be affected by the change.</p>\n<h2>What are the legal arguments for and against excluding unauthorized immigrants from reapportionment totals?</h2>\n<p>The Justice Department argues that federal law gives the president discretion to make policy judgments about whom the census counts. That discretion includes setting the definition of an \u201cinhabitant\u201d or \u201cusual resident\u201d of the United States, two terms that have historically been used to describe people who qualify to be counted in a census.</p>\n<p>The president\u2019s lawyers say federal law gives \u201cvirtually unfettered discretion\u201d to the Commerce Department \u2014 the federal agency that oversees the Census Bureau \u2014 to decide what data is used in counting individual residents of states.</p>\n<p>Opponents of the president\u2019s plan say 230 years of history are on their side. Noncitizens have been counted in every census \u2014 and used in every reapportionment of the House \u2014 since the very first census was conducted in 1790. In the nation\u2019s early history, a substantial share of the population had migrated from other countries, and for many decades thereafter, some states actively recruited foreigners to provide labor and boost political representation. The framers of the Constitution elected to exclude some people from being counted \u2014 specifying \u201cIndians not taxed\u201d and, most notoriously, deciding to count someone who was enslaved as three-fifths of a person \u2014 but left noncitizens intact. The drafters of the 14th Amendment debated whether to count all immigrants for apportionment purposes, and elected in the end to do so.</p>\n<p>The opponents also say that the Constitution explicitly requires that the decennial census be used for reapportionment, and that Mr. Trump has no authority to deduct unauthorized immigrants from that census before sending population totals to the House.</p>\n<h2>How have federal courts ruled on the issue so far?</h2>\n<p>Three courts \u2014 in New York, Maryland and California \u2014 have ruled against the White House on varying grounds and in some cases barred the Commerce Department from sending a count of unauthorized immigrants to the White House. The California court ruled that excluding noncitizens violated both federal law and the Constitution.</p>\n<p>In New York, a panel of three judges, two appointed by President George W. Bush and one by President Barack Obama, said unanimously that \u201cthe merits of the parties\u2019 dispute are not particularly close or complicated.\u201d The panel said federal law required the government to produce a single set of population figures for reapportionment, making Mr. Trump\u2019s plan for a separate estimate of unauthorized immigrants moot. The judges also said that \u201cso long as they reside in the United States, illegal aliens qualify as \u2018persons\u2019 in a \u2018state\u2019 as Congress used those words.\u201d</p>\n<p>Because of that, the judges said, there was no need to take up the question of whether the president\u2019s plan also violated the Constitution.</p>\n<h2>Is it even possible to count the number of unauthorized immigrants in the country?</h2>\n<p>It would be extremely hard, if only because many of them are trying their best to avoid being seen for fear of deportation. The Trump administration had ordered the Census Bureau to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census in an attempt to come up with a tally, but the Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that the Commerce Department had failed to offer a plausible explanation of why the question was needed.</p>\n<p>On the president\u2019s order, a Census Bureau task force is working to provide a count anyway, mostly by sifting through federal and state records that show conclusively who is a citizen \u2014 and by implication, who is not. A handful of records, such as compilations of people marked for deportation, do identify people who are in the county illegally, but those tallies are a small fraction of the entire population of unauthorized immigrants.</p>\n<p>It appears unlikely that the bureau will produce an estimate of unauthorized immigrants by the Dec. 31 statutory deadline for sending population totals to the White House. Indeed, Census Bureau officials told the Commerce Department this month that the 2020 census itself could not be completed until after Mr. Trump leaves office on Jan. 20. The bureau\u2019s experts nevertheless are racing to complete a count of unauthorized immigrants for delivery to Mr. Trump in early or mid-January.</p>"

                "byline": "By Maeve Higgins",
                "body": "<p>Take it from me, a noncitizen, there is much to learn from the naturalization test, one of the final hurdles an immigrant must clear to become a citizen.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s pretty tough actually, particularly the new and expanded version of the civics test that is to go into effect on Dec. 1. To those of us living under The Stephen Miller School of Exclusion, this is one more barrier to an immigrant\u2019s quest to live here. The questions and answers are online now. I\u2019ve been practicing in a variety of American accents.</p>\n<p>The latest test has 128 civics questions about American government and history. Just getting to take the test usually means you\u2019ve made it through an obstacle course involving reams of paperwork, thousands of dollars in lawyer and government fees, years of legal residency, a biometrics appointment and an English proficiency test. The questions come in the form of an oral test where an officer from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, U.S.C.I.S., asks the would-be citizen to answer 20 of the 128 civics questions; if she gets 12 right, she passes. After that, all she needs to do is pick up her paperwork. Then she can pledge allegiance to the flag and decide which season of \u201cReal Housewives\u201d to watch to truly understand this complex nation.</p>\n<p>The latest test is a jump from the current one, which requires you to study only 100 questions, and answer 10 of them, with 6 correct answers, to pass. The Trump administration has left almost no part of the immigration system untouched. It made changes large and small, from thundering bans of entire nationalities to insidious but potent administrative changes like this one. However innocuous some changes may seem, they illuminate the end goal: curbing legal immigration.</p>\n<p>As with many Trumpian ideas, the seeds were there all along. The Naturalization Act of 1906 first decreed that citizens-to-be must speak English, and while English is not the official language of the United States, most immigrants today still have to pass an English proficiency test. The civics test is carried out only in English.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m a native English speaker, but I still find some questions difficult to understand. And unlike the study guide online, the questions are not multiple choice. That means that one day, if I get to take the test, I will have to try to keep a straight face as I look into another human being\u2019s eyes and try to answer the question, \u201cWhy is the Electoral College important?\u201d</p>\n<p>Some people have an easier ride. If you are 65 or older and have 20 years of permanent residency under your belt, you are required to answer fewer questions. This makes me feel better about the substantial errors made by the 66-year-old senator-elect from Alabama, Tommy Tuberville. In an interview this month in The Alabama Daily News, Mr. Tuberville got the three branches of the federal government wrong and misidentified the reason the United States fought in World War II. To be fair, Mr. Tuberville played football for a long time. It is my understanding that this extremely American game involves repeated bashes to the head, one of which is bound to knock out some civics knowledge.</p>\n<p>Speaking of senators, one of the more sinister changes to the civics test is the answer to the question, \u201cWho does a U.S. Senator represent?\u201d The only acceptable answer has been changed from all people of their state to citizens of their state. I\u2019m just a person, not a citizen. Am I not worthy of representation? There was a whole kerfuffle about taxation without representation back in the day, I believe.</p>\n<p>Simone Hanlon Shook is worried about these changes. \u201cIt\u2019s just really punitive to people that don\u2019t have advanced degrees and it\u2019s not in their first language,\u201d she told me. She said she was not worried about passing her own test when she took it on Oct. 7. It was the shorter and simpler one. Plus, she is a high school history teacher. Originally from Ireland, Ms. Hanlon Shook lives in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and in past years used the U.S.C.I.S. questions to quiz her high school students as she waited her turn to take the real thing. \u201cThe idea was: if you weren\u2019t a citizen, would you pass this test? And a lot of them wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her turn finally came during a pandemic, so the U.S.C.I.S. officer brought her into a room with an iPad, and then he went to the room right next to hers and conducted the interview virtually. She got 100 percent of the questions right and on Oct. 23 she was presented with her citizenship papers and a small American flag during a drive-through ceremony in a parking lot beside the Albany airport. The next day, she told me, she voted in the presidential election.</p>\n<p>One day I hope to do the same, so I\u2019m taking practice questions when I can. This one caught me out. \u201cWhat is Alexander Hamilton famous for?\u201d He\u2019s famous for his cool ponytail and for being a breakout star on Broadway, right? Wrong. Apparently he\u2019s famous for being \u201cone of the writers of the Federalist papers.\u201d Not sure what those are, but they sound serious.</p>\n<p>Another one is \u201cName one example of an American innovation.\u201d Voodoo-flavored Zapp\u2019s chips spring to mind, as does unearned confidence. However, neither is included in the list of acceptable answers. Instead: light bulbs, skyscrapers and landing on the moon.</p>\n<p>Hernan Prieto is the citizenship program coordinator at Irish Community Services, a nonprofit in Chicago that provides immigration and social services to immigrants of any nationality in the Midwest. Part of his job is preparing immigrants for the civics test. Unlike Senator-elect Tuberville, his students usually get the question about the branches of government right. They are also familiar with some of the names on the test, he told me. They know who Martin Luther King Jr. is and why he is important. Dates trip them up, though.</p>\n<p>A green card holder from Argentina, Mr. Prieto hopes to apply for naturalization next year, and he told me he appreciates what he learns alongside other immigrants. Most crucially, studying civics informs would-be Americans of what they stand to gain and what they need to give if they hope to live up to this nation\u2019s earliest motto. They learn that motto too; it\u2019s \u201cE Pluribus Unum\u201d or \u201cOut of many, one.\u201d They learn that equality is promised by the Constitution, that nobody is above the law and that it is a civic duty to vote.</p>\n<p>Mr. Prieto treasures that knowledge, but is not convinced that the test itself is helpful. \u201cI don\u2019t know that we need to have a formal test, with 128 questions that you need to learn, and get 12 of them right,\u201d he said. \u201cDo we really need that? What is important for a new citizen is to know their rights and their responsibilities. That is what levels them with other citizens.\u201d</p>\n<p>Maeve Higgins (@maevehiggins) is the author of \u201cMaeve in America: Essays by a Girl From Somewhere Else\u201d and a contributing Opinion writer.</p>\n<p>The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

                "byline": "By Barbara Slavin",
                "body": "<p>When Israel engineered the assassinations of a half-dozen Iranian nuclear scientists from 2010 to 2012, supporters of these killings argued that they would help slow a nuclear program at a time when multilateral diplomacy was showing little progress.</p>\n<p>The killing on Friday of Iran\u2019s top nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, comes in a very different context.</p>\n<p>Iran is again producing a large amount of uranium, but it is not close to the level needed to produce a nuclear weapon. Its actions are largely driven by the Trump administration\u2019s unilateral withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, which was intended to put a lid on Iran\u2019s ability to amass enough highly enriched uranium for a single weapon until January 2031.</p>\n<p>Iran has said repeatedly that it will go back into full compliance with the nuclear agreement if the Biden administration agrees to do the same, and lifts the onerous sanctions piled on by President Trump.</p>\n<p>So why kill Mr. Fakhrizadeh now?</p>\n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, with the support of President Trump, seems intent on scorching the earth to make it harder for any return to diplomacy under President-elect Joe Biden.</p>\n<p>Israel and the Trump administration apparently fear that a Biden administration would seek a quick return to the nuclear agreement, which could revive Iran\u2019s struggling economy and make it harder to contain its influence in the Middle East. Killing Mr. Fakhrizadeh makes that all the more difficult.</p>\n<p>The Israeli government, as is its wont, has not taken responsibility for the assassination, but numerous published reports \u2014 and the audacious manner in which Mr. Fakhrizadeh was killed \u2014 strongly point toward agents of the Mossad. For its part, the Trump administration may or may not have known about the plot in advance, but Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, was recently in Israel, and the administration has not condemned the killing so far.</p>\n<p>The killing of Mr. Fakhrizadeh, the reputed mastermind of Iran\u2019s past weaponization efforts, will not dent Iran\u2019s nuclear expertise, which is considerable. According to American intelligence, Iran did have a program aimed at producing nuclear warheads that ended 17 years ago, after it was detected by the C.I.A. and revealed by an Iranian opposition group.</p>\n<p>The latest killing may not provoke Iran to build nuclear weapons, but it will likely feed the animosity between the United States and Iran, making diplomacy that much harder. It could strengthen hard-line factions in Iran arguing against a return to diplomacy \u2014 factions seeking to complete their control of Iranian politics in presidential elections scheduled for June.</p>\n<p>Iran\u2019s leadership reacted angrily but cautiously to the assassination. President Hassan Rouhani has said that Iran will respond in a manner and at a time of its own choosing. He blamed Israel, adding, \u201cThis brutal assassination shows that our enemies are passing through anxious weeks, weeks that they feel their pressure era is coming to an end and the global conditions are changing.\u201d</p>\n<p>That statement suggests that Iran will seek revenge against Israel in some other form. Iran may increase its support for Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad. It will ensure that Israel remains \u201cthe lesser Satan\u201d in Iranian propaganda for the foreseeable future, and Israeli soft targets \u2014 such as tourists and students \u2014 could be at risk, along with Israeli officials overseas. Americans, too, may be vulnerable for their association with Israel \u2014 on top of the Trump administration\u2019s assassination of the Iranian senior general Qassim Suleimani in January.</p>\n<p>With temperatures running so high, the incoming Biden administration now faces a serious challenge. Mr. Biden has vowed to return to negotiations with Iran, but he and his team cannot do much more than message through the media to Iran to stay patient until the inauguration on Jan. 20 \u2014 and to the Israelis to stop their campaign of sabotage.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, European countries that have diplomatic relations with Iran and are still parties to the nuclear agreement can help bridge the gap until the Biden inauguration. Britain, France and Germany should seek a swift convening of the commission that monitors implementation of the Iran nuclear agreement. Their foreign ministers should act even sooner and issue a statement condemning the assassination as illegal under international law and damaging to the cause of nonproliferation. A spokesperson for the European Union\u2019s high representative for foreign and security policy has already described the killing as a \u201ccriminal act.\u201d</p>\n<p>For a variety of reasons, Iran\u2019s nuclear program has been slow moving. It began in the 1950s with the gift of knowledge from the Eisenhower administration under the \u201cAtoms for Peace\u201d initiative. The Johnson administration gave Iran its first small nuclear research reactor a decade later.</p>\n<p>In the more than 60 years since Iran\u2019s nuclear efforts began, Israel, India, Pakistan and North Korea have all developed bombs. Iran has not. It still has only one functioning nuclear power plant.</p>\n<p>It would be the ultimate tragedy if Israel\u2019s aggression now led Iran to change its calculus and go for weapons. This could spark a nuclear arms race throughout the region and ensure that the Middle East remains dysfunctional, riven by sectarian and other conflicts, its peoples\u2019 potential for productive work stymied and its youth vulnerable to recruitment by terrorists who have struck innocent people around the world.</p>\n<p>Barbara Slavin (@BarbaraSlavin1) directs the Future of Iran Initiative at the Atlantic Council.</p>\n<p>The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

                "byline": "By Rosa Brooks",
                "body": "<p>President-elect Joe Biden has begun to announce his intended cabinet nominees, and it\u2019s an impressive and diverse group: his picks include an experienced African-American diplomat for ambassador to the United Nations; the first Latino nominated as homeland security secretary; and the first woman tapped to serve as director of national intelligence.</p>\n<p>Mr. Biden has remained silent, however, about whom he might select as secretary of defense. For years, the betting has been on Mich\u00e8le Flournoy, an under secretary of defense for policy in the Obama administration who is widely viewed as one of the nation\u2019s top defense policy experts. But although Ms. Flournoy \u2014 for whom I worked from 2009 to 2011 \u2014 is reported to still be a leading contender, along with a number of other well-regarded women, there has recently been speculation that Mr. Biden may instead choose one of several men also said to be on his short list.</p>\n<p>That would be shortsighted. If Mr. Biden nominates a respected and highly qualified woman as his secretary of defense, he would send an important and long overdue message \u2014 that the Defense Department\u2019s old norms and biases were a disservice not only to women working in national security, but to the country.</p>\n<p>The Defense Department has long been viewed as singularly inhospitable to women. National security leaders (nearly always male) have for years argued that there just weren\u2019t enough qualified female candidates to fill senior positions in the Defense Department \u2014 an excuse that might once have had some validity, but rings hollow today. Over the last two decades, an impressive new generation of female defense experts has emerged.</p>\n<p>There are now scores of talented women who have spent years mastering everything from military strategy to budgeting, logistics and acquisitions. In September, the Leadership Council for Women in National Security \u2014 which I co-founded and whose advisers include such luminaries as former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and retired Adm. Michelle Howard, the Navy\u2019s first female African-American four-star \u2014 provided the Biden transition team with the names of at least four qualified women for every Senate-confirmed national security position.</p>\n<p>If it took decades for a sizable pool of highly qualified women to emerge as potential senior Pentagon leaders, that\u2019s no accident. For most of our nation\u2019s history, overtly discriminatory legislation and Defense Department rules severely limited women\u2019s ability to rise.</p>\n<p>In recent years, even as other foreign policy agencies opened their senior ranks to women, the doors at the Pentagon remained largely closed. At the end of the Obama administration, for instance, women made up 41 percent of senior State Department officials, but just 22 percent of senior Defense Department civilian officials, according to a 2018 analysis conducted by New America.</p>\n<p>In the uniformed military, gender equality has proved even more elusive than racial equality. Racial discrimination in the military was barred by a 1948 executive order, and the first African-American four-star general was appointed in 1975. In 1989, the first African-American chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was appointed.</p>\n<p>But in the very same year the military was ordered to integrate racially, Congress also passed legislation mandating that women make up no more than 2 percent of military personnel \u2014 a cap that was lifted only in the 1970s. Even today, women constitute only 16.5 percent of the active duty force, and the first female four-star general wasn\u2019t appointed until 2008.</p>\n<p>Until 2015, women were also barred from serving in combat roles. This made it difficult for women to gain senior military positions, which go mostly to those with distinguished combat records. And since nearly half of all Defense Department civilian employees are military veterans who get preferential hiring, the same discriminatory policies that kept most uniformed women out of senior jobs also made it tougher for civilian women to be hired and promoted on an equal basis.</p>\n<p>These laws and policies weren\u2019t just unfair to women, they also diminished the country\u2019s ability to develop smart, effective national security policies. Studies suggest that organizations with gender-diverse leadership teams outperform organizations with male-dominated leadership, and that diverse organizations are less prone to \u201cgroupthink.\u201d</p>\n<p>On average, women appear to have more collaborative leadership styles than men, and they\u2019re also less likely than men to fall prey to judgment errors induced by overconfidence. Wouldn\u2019t it be wiser to have more collaboration, less groupthink and less recklessness in our military policy?</p>\n<p>The United States faces national security problems ranging from the pandemic to climate change, refugee crises and the rise of near-peer competitors such as China. These complex and interconnected issues require fresh approaches, not a reversion to old modes of thinking about defense policy.</p>\n<p>If Mr. Biden chooses a woman as his secretary of defense, it will pack a uniquely powerful symbolic punch \u2014 signaling both his repudiation of the Defense Department\u2019s history of sex-based discrimination and his intent to build the kind of diverse, innovative national security leadership team the nation so urgently needs.</p>\n<p>Rosa Brooks, a professor at Georgetown Law and a co-founder of the Leadership Council for Women in National Security, is the author of \u201cHow Everything Became War and the Military Became Everything\u201d and the forthcoming \u201cTangled Up in Blue: Policing the American City.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

                "body": "<p>WASHINGTON \u2014 A skeptical Supreme Court on Monday reacted with frustration and some confusion to President Trump\u2019s plan to exclude unauthorized immigrants from the calculations used to allocate seats in the House.</p>\n<p>While there was some discussion about whether the plan was lawful, the more immediate questions for the justices were where the administration stood in its efforts to identify and count the unauthorized immigrants and what role the court should play if substantial numbers were not identified.</p>\n<p>Removing undocumented immigrants from the census would most likely have the effect of shifting congressional seats and federal money to states that are older, whiter and typically more Republican.</p>\n<p>But if the Census Bureau cannot provide Mr. Trump with specific information about a large enough number of unauthorized immigrants in the coming weeks, he will not be able to exclude enough of them from the reapportionment to change the way House seats are allocated. That would leave the justices without a concrete dispute to decide.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe situation is fairly fluid,\u201d Jeffrey B. Wall, the acting United States solicitor general, told the justices, conceding that the Census Bureau may not be able to supply Mr. Trump with much data on unauthorized immigrants. \u201cThere is a real prospect that the numbers will not affect the apportionment,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said that put the court in an odd position.</p>\n<p>\u201cI find the posture of this case quite frustrating,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could be that this is much ado about very little.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Commerce Department is required to supply census information to the president by the end of the year, but it may not be able to meet that deadline. Mr. Wall indicated that the Census Bureau had good data on the tens of thousands of people held by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but the number is almost certainly too small to change apportionment.</p>\n<p>He was less certain that the bureau could match records concerning people subject to orders of removal, young immigrants known as Dreamers or other categories of unauthorized immigrants.</p>\n<p>If there is data to allow Mr. Trump to exclude enough immigrants to change the allocation of House seats, the case would become quite important.</p>\n<p>Indeed, if the court rules for the administration on the core question in the case, it would upend a longtime consensus that the government must count all residents of the United States, whatever their immigration status, with the potential to shift political power and federal money from Democratic states to Republican ones.</p>\n<p>But there was only limited discussion of that question on Monday, though several justices, including some conservatives, expressed skepticism about the administration\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p>\u201cA lot of the historical evidence and longstanding practice really cuts against your position,\u201d Justice Amy Coney Barrett told Mr. Wall.</p>\n<p>He responded that the novelty of Mr. Trump\u2019s approach did not make it unlawful. \u201cI\u2019ll certainly grant,\u201d Mr. Wall said, \u201cthat no president has made this judgment before.\u201d</p>\n<p>Most of the argument focused on the practical complications in the case. </p>\n<p>Mr. Wall said the process was cumbersome and difficult. \u201cWe\u2019re literally trying to individually identify people who are present in the United States in violation of federal law,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Mr. Wall suggested that the plaintiffs could file a new lawsuit after Mr. Trump submits a statement to Congress setting out the number of representatives to which each state is entitled if House seats shift because of the exclusion of unauthorized immigrants.</p>\n<p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. was skeptical. \u201cIsn\u2019t that going to be like having to unscramble the eggs?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>Other justices wondered whether the court should simply defer a decision in the current case, which it had put on an exceptionally fast track, until more information becomes available in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>The Constitution requires congressional districts to be apportioned \u201ccounting the whole number of persons in each state,\u201d using information from the census. In July, Mr. Trump issued a memorandum taking a new approach. \u201cFor the purpose of the reapportionment of representatives following the 2020 census,\u201d the memo said, \u201cit is the policy of the United States to exclude from the apportionment base aliens who are not in a lawful immigration status.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCurrent estimates suggest that one state is home to more than 2.2 million illegal aliens, constituting more than 6 percent of the state\u2019s entire population,\u201d the memo said, apparently referring to California. \u201cIncluding these illegal aliens in the population of the state for the purpose of apportionment could result in the allocation of two or three more congressional seats than would otherwise be allocated.\u201d</p>\n<p>In the memo, Mr. Trump ordered Wilbur Ross, the secretary of commerce, to provide him with two sets of numbers, one including unauthorized immigrants and the other not. But it became unclear how Mr. Ross would derive the second set of numbers after the Supreme Court last year rejected his efforts to add a question on citizenship to the census.</p>\n<p>The case before the court, Trump v. New York, No. 20-366, was brought by two sets of plaintiffs, one a group of state and local governments and the United States Conference of Mayors, and the second a coalition of advocacy groups and other nongovernmental organizations.</p>\n<p>A three-judge panel of the Federal District Court in Manhattan ruled that the new policy violated federal law. Two other courts have issued similar rulings, while one said the dispute was not ripe for consideration.</p>\n<p>In an unsigned opinion in the case from Manhattan, the panel said the question before it was \u201cnot particularly close or complicated.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe secretary is required to report a single set of figures to the president \u2014 namely, \u2018the tabulation of total population by states\u2019 under the \u2018decennial census\u2019 \u2014 and the president is then required to use those same figures to determine apportionment using the method of equal proportions,\u201d the panel wrote, quoting the relevant statutes.</p>\n<p>Chief Justice Roberts questioned the first part of the analysis. \u201cIt seems to me that you\u2019re asking really for a gag order on the secretary of commerce concerning his communications to the president,\u201d he told Barbara D. Underwood, New York\u2019s solicitor general.</p>\n<p>Ms. Underwood said the secretary was free to provide information about unauthorized immigrants in other ways. \u201cIt might be usable for many other things,\u201d she said, \u201cbut not as part of the apportionment.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Wall told the justices that it was lawful to exclude unauthorized immigrants. \u201cIt\u2019s the sovereign\u2019s prerogative to define the political community,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Ms. Underwood responded that the administration was asking the court to endorse a stunning departure from the nation\u2019s traditions.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Constitution and laws provide that House seats should be allocated on the basis of total population,\u201d she said. \u201cThe framers wanted a system that could not easily be manipulated. So they decided to count just the persons living in each state. The policy here would for the first time in this nation\u2019s history reject that choice.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dale Ho, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, said Mr. Trump\u2019s authority was limited.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhile the president may have some discretion in borderline cases,\u201d Mr. Ho said, \u201che does not have authority to erase millions of state residents from the apportionment based solely on unlawful immigration status.\u201d</p>\n<p>The argument was conducted by telephone, with the justices asking questions one at a time, in order of seniority, subject to strict time limits enforced by the chief justice. At one point, Justice Alito seemed to chafe at that restriction, launching into a six-part question after the chief justice had indicated that his time was up.</p>\n<p>He managed to ask three of his six questions before Chief Justice Roberts cut him off.</p>"

                "body": "<p>GENEVA \u2014 The annual choice of who will steer the United Nations\u2019 top human rights organization is usually done quietly and by consensus. For months, this year\u2019s selection seemed to follow that script.</p>\n<p>Until a week ago, that is, when an unexpected contest emerged over the 2021 presidency of the organization, the U.N. Human Rights Council. The position \u2014 which holds significant sway over a body that, despite its name, includes some of the world\u2019s worst rights abusers \u2014 rotates by region, and is due to be filled next year by a member of the Asia-Pacific bloc of countries.</p>\n<p>The dispute over the council presidency is pitting some of the U.N.\u2019s most powerful member states against tiny Pacific Island nations, and is playing out as U.N. members jockey for influence in anticipation of a new, more engaged American administration.</p>\n<p>For months, the only announced candidate to lead the council next year was Fiji\u2019s U.N. ambassador, Nazhat Shameem Khan, the country\u2019s first female High Court judge, a former prosecutor and a diplomat well regarded by Western nations.</p>\n<p>But three days before the deadline for applications, another member of the regional bloc, Bahrain, tossed its hat in the ring and told Fiji to step aside, setting off a round of infighting. </p>\n<p>Bahrain is closely aligned with Saudi Arabia, whose human rights record \u2014 including the state-sponsored killing of the dissident Jamal Khashoggi \u2014 is bad enough that it suffered an embarrassing defeat this fall when it sought only a seat on the council. Syria, a member of the bloc aligned with Russia and with a long and notorious record of abuses, also pledged to block Fiji.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was quite a shock,\u201d Doreen de Brum, a diplomat from another Pacific nation, the Marshall Islands, said of the opposition. \u201cWe thought Fiji would be the sole name.\u201d</p>\n<p>Geneva-based diplomats interpret opposition to Fiji\u2019s candidacy as an effort by China, Russia and Saudi Arabia to put the council\u2019s presidency in the hands of a compliant state as the role of the United States takes new shape under the incoming Biden administration.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey feel they are losing control,\u201d Marc Limon, a former diplomat and director of the Universal Rights Group, a think tank, said of opponents to Fiji\u2019s candidacy.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe lengths they went to and the level of subterfuge employed to pull this off suggests they had one eye on a Biden administration return to the council,\u201d Mr. Limon added. China, in particular, has tried to take advantage of America\u2019s absence from the council to expand its influence.</p>\n<p>The Geneva-based Human Rights Council, whose mission is to promote and protect rights, includes representatives from 47 nations elected to staggered three-year terms.</p>\n<p>As a member for two years, Fiji has backed investigations into reported abuses in Venezuela, Belarus, Syria and Yemen \u2014 the sort of country-specific resolutions that have been fiercely denounced by China and others.</p>\n<p>The issue has particular resonance as 2021 looms. Western governments hope the United States will re-engage with the council under President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., filling a vacuum left when the Trump administration walked out on the body in 2018.</p>\n<p>Western governments have wanted the council to consider changes that would encourage U.S. reinvolvement after the Trump administration denounced the body as a \u201ccesspool\u201d of anti-Israel bias.</p>\n<p>These diplomats want the council to reconsider why Israel is the only nation treated as a standing item on its agenda. They also hope to introduce tougher rules for council membership, another issue cited by the Trump administration when it pulled out.</p>\n<p>A council president aligned with states hostile to reform would be in a position to steer the council toward other business, sidelining American interests along the way. Though the council president has little direct authority, the person can significantly influence its priorities.</p>\n<p>It has been led for the past year by the Austrian ambassador Elisabeth Tichy-Fisslberger, who has been known for her persistence and adroit leadership. The council had risked shutting down during the Covid-19 pandemic, but instead it completed two sessions, leading to action on high-profile issues ranging from racism in the United States to human rights abuses in Venezuela.</p>\n<p>Fiji\u2019s prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, far from backing down, has been contacting fellow Pacific Island leaders to rally support for his country\u2019s candidacy.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, the Marshall Islands said it would reject any candidate but Fiji and demanded a meeting of the Asia-Pacific group to sort the matter out. Qatar, which is at odds with Saudi Arabia, said it would also oppose the candidacy of Bahrain and its ambassador, Yusuf Abdulkarim Bucheeri.</p>\n<p>That could set the stage for a vote by the bloc in the coming weeks.</p>"

                "body": "<p>As the Trump presidency fades to black, it is time for Washington to get to work. In embracing Joe Biden, the American people cast a vote for civility, pragmatism and competence. Lawmakers now have a duty to hunker down and find ways to make progress on critical issues. But with both chambers of Congress narrowly divided and ideologically polarized, coming together on even the most modest deals could prove daunting.</p>\n<p>One promising move under consideration: bringing back congressional earmarks.</p>\n<p>Loosely speaking, earmarks are spending requests \u2014 or, depending on your definition, also limited tax or tariff benefits \u2014 inserted into bills at the behest of individual lawmakers for the benefit of specific entities in specific locations. Think: funding for a domestic violence crisis center in Alaska or for STEM programs in a rural school district in Colorado.</p>\n<p>In the big picture, earmarks add up to little more than a rounding error, generally constituting not more than 1 percent of the federal budget. They are used to determine spending priorities, not spending levels, meaning they determine how the pie gets divided rather than how big it is.</p>\n<p>As conceived, earmarks allow the people who presumably best understand a state or district \u2014 its elected officials \u2014 to direct federal dollars to where they are most needed. In practice, they also gets used for all kinds of daffy or ill-conceived projects. Remember the infamous Bridge to Nowhere? Classic earmarking. At its most vile, the process veers into organized bribery, as special interests pursue ethically questionable, and occasionally illegal, means to get lawmakers to champion their pet issues. In the mid-2000s, a handful of earmark-related scandals landed some prominent political players in prison. Earmarks became a tidy symbol of government waste and corruption.</p>\n<p>In 2007, the Democratic-controlled House began reforming the practice, increasing transparency and accountability. Members were required to attach their names to requests and to certify that they had no financial interests in the projects. Beneficiaries were limited to nonprofit entities or public projects. In 2011, Republicans assumed control of the chamber and went even further, declaring a moratorium on earmarks.</p>\n<p>This ban has made Congress less accountable and more dysfunctional. It is time to abandon the experiment.</p>\n<p>Despite their bad reputation, earmarks are not inherently corrupt. Since America\u2019s earliest days, they have proved a useful tool for building coalitions. (The first known instance of congressional earmarking dates to the Lighthouse Act of 1789.) Nothing greases the gears of government quite like pork. A lawmaker may not care for a larger bill per se, but the ability to slip in a little something for the voters back home can be a compelling motivator. \u201cWithout earmarks to offer, it\u2019s hard to herd the cats,\u201d John Boehner, the former House speaker, once observed.</p>\n<p>It is this utility that many earmark opponents object to. They do not want costly legislation to be easier to pass. The budget watchdog group Citizens Against Government Waste warns that \u201cearmarks cause members to vote for excessively expensive spending bills that cost tens or hundreds of billions of dollars in exchange for a few earmarks worth a few million or sometimes just thousands of dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p>Considering the thicket of crises the nation is facing, big-ticket legislation, including another meaty round of coronavirus relief, is precisely what is needed.</p>\n<p>Of course, the earmark ban didn\u2019t really ban earmarks. Pork spending simply became stealthier, with some members falling back on similar, more convoluted moves such as \u201cphonemarking\u201d or \u201clettermarking.\u201d Worse, non-earmark earmarks are not subject to the same transparency requirements, making them harder to track. So much for increased accountability.</p>\n<p>There are also questions of constitutional authority. When Congress declines to specify how the money it appropriates is spent, the executive branch is happy to fill the void. Curtailing congressional earmarks \u201csimply shifts that power more explicitly to a president and a cadre of unelected bureaucrats,\u201d according to John Hudak, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution and the author of \u201cPresidential Pork.\u201d \u201cEliminating earmarking is a serious abdication of power by Congress which empowers a branch of government beyond what the Founders intended,\u201d he has argued.</p>\n<p>This argument should have special appeal for Republican lawmakers, who like to complain that unelected bureaucrats and unaccountable regulators have too much authority.</p>\n<p>Since 2011, clusters of lawmakers have periodically flirted with restoring earmarks, only to abandon the efforts. The practice remains easy to demagogue, especially with mistrust of government running high. In the wake of this month\u2019s election, House Democrats are approaching the issue with renewed energy. In a recent interview with Roll Call, Steny Hoyer, the majority leader, said that once the new chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee is chosen, she would begin asking members to submit \u201ccongressional initiatives for their districts and their states.\u201d</p>\n<p>Members in both chambers should facilitate this process \u2014 working to ensure that the new system has maximum transparency and sufficient oversight, of course. Earmarks are not a magic cure-all for today\u2019s hyperpolarized politics. They are unlikely to, for instance, convince conservatives to support the Green New Deal or members of the progressive \u201cSquad\u201d to back corporate tax breaks. But restoring positive incentives for lawmakers to embrace negotiation and compromise could provide at least some counterbalance to the partisan forces fueling rigidity and gridlock.</p>\n<p>The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

                "body": "<p>I am not a private person \u2014 quite the opposite \u2014 but I do have two secrets. The first concerns some Bad Events that happened to me long ago (yes, it\u2019s the sort of thing you are thinking of), and the second is an unrelated Fact about my neurological makeup.</p>\n<p>Let me be clear: I am not ashamed of either of these things. Keeping them secret creates, in me, an uncomfortable feeling, as though I were hiding something, as though I were ashamed, and that bugs me all the time, like a scratchy tag in my clothing. But I can\u2019t tell you what The Fact is, because you won\u2019t believe me; and I can't tell you about The Events, because you will.</p>\n<p>I have barely told you anything about The Events, but I suspect that you have already started believing. You want to be someone who believes women; you see this as the belief-challenge you have been waiting for; you want to rise to it. When I first told a therapist about The Events, she said: \u201cOf course. In retrospect it makes perfect sense of so many things \u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Later she apologized for this as therapeutic overreach. Even therapists can\u2019t help themselves \u2014 they are off to the races, believing and believing. On this topic, so much gets packaged into \u201cbeing believed\u201d that I fear the more I tell you, the less you will understand me.</p>\n<p>I don't want you to think you know the meaning of The Events; I don\u2019t want to be classified as damaged; I don\u2019t want you to feel good about yourself for believing me; I don\u2019t want you to feel sorry for me; and most of all, I don\u2019t want you to praise my courage for \u201ccoming forward\u201d or for \u201csurviving.\u201d The prospect of receiving praise or honor for this revelation fills with me with rage \u2014 when I imagine your admiration, I immediately imagine throwing it back in your face.</p>\n<p>The Fact I\u2019d like to tell you has to do with a difference between how we \u2014 you and I \u2014 think. But to get specific about this difference, I have to use a word you associate with people who don\u2019t talk, who can\u2019t take care of themselves, whose inner lives seem utterly obscure to you, people who harm themselves, people you struggle to see as human, people whose existence you see as a tragedy.</p>\n<p>And you will find this comparison preposterous. You will tell me I shouldn\u2019t use \u201cthat word,\u201d you will helpfully offer me milder alternatives. You might acknowledge that I\u2019m \u201cquirky\u201d or \u201cidiosyncratic\u201d \u2014 in a good way! \u2014 and that a few of those quirks may superficially resemble those people. But I have a professional career, a family. I can\u2019t be like them. (Ask yourself: how much knowledge would you need, really, to be certain of this?)</p>\n<p>You might be willing to budge a little if you could hear it from some medical professionals \u2014 though one might not be enough. You\u2019d need a second and third opinion. Notice that if I told you I had cancer or diabetes or depression, or for that matter that I was left-handed, you would not insist on seeing my papers. You would not be inclined to think I was faking my left-handedness by having trained myself to use my left hand; or that I resembled depressed people only \u201cin some respects.\u201d</p>\n<p>In the case of The Events, you are eager to assign victim status to me; in the case of The Fact, you are wary of assigning it to me. For you, there is only one question: how much suffering can she legitimately lay claim to?</p>\n<p>You are so busy trying to answer this question \u2014 trying to serve as judge in the pain/suffering/disadvantage Olympics \u2014 that you cannot hear anything I am trying to tell you. And that means I can\u2019t talk to you. No one can sincerely assert words whose meaning she knows will be garbled by the lexicon of her interlocutor. I don\u2019t want privacy, but you\u2019ve forced it onto me.</p>\n<p>You might wonder why I have to tell you these things. Couldn\u2019t I find a supportive community of people who endured similar Events, and wouldn\u2019t I be believed by other Fact-Bearers? Yes, and individual connections of this kind are very valuable, but at the group level this kind of support has never worked for me.</p>\n<p>Being surrounded by people who are supposedly like me inevitably leads me to feel maximally \u201cdifferent.\u201d Probably my failure to benefit from such communities is a sign that I have not suffered so much, and deserve very little victim credit. So be it!</p>\n<p>Solidarity is not my thing, openness is. It is a consequence of The Fact, for me, that I lean toward transparency in all contexts: I have to consciously prevent myself from oversharing (even more than I do), and I am honest from necessity rather than virtue.</p>\n<p>There is a reason for all of this, which is that I am bad \u2014 really bad, you cannot imagine how bad \u2014 at figuring things out on my own. If I take too many steps in reasoning without the intervention of another person, I go very far wrong. So I have accustomed myself to reasoning in public as much as I can, to making sure to expose my mistakes to correction.</p>\n<p>I know that I don\u2019t know what corner assistance might come from. I don\u2019t want to confide in a select group of people who grumble among themselves about how you misunderstand \u201cus.\u201d I want to talk to you, any and all of you, freely, so you can help me stop misunderstanding myself.</p>\n<p>The truth is that I don\u2019t know the meaning of The Events, for my life. Isn\u2019t it at least possible that they simply don\u2019t have any meaning? Or maybe the meaning will change once I am allowed to speak them out loud? Perhaps I really am scarred for life, but do we have to assume that from the outset?</p>\n<p>If I could talk it through, I might have a hope of figuring this out. Because that is mostly how I figure out all the difficult problems of my life: I talk about them to whoever is available, whenever the problems seem relevant to something else I am thinking about; I listen; I rethink; I write; I circle back and write something else; over and over again; and over time I develop a stable picture.</p>\n<p>With The Events, I am at sea. For so long I did not even allow myself to speak them to myself. Now that I can, it chafes at me that you have decided that if I want to talk about them with you, I have to follow your rules, and let you trample all over me. Perhaps more people who have experienced Events would talk about them with you if they thought you would do less \u201cbelieving\u201d and more listening.</p>\n<p>Factwise, this is what I want to know: what, if anything, ties together the \u201csuperficial\u201d differences in how I dress, how I talk, how my mind jumps around, my repetitive movements, my sensitivities, the kinds of patterns I see and the kinds I miss, my obsessions, my literal-mindedness, my odd oscillations between needing to be alone and needing to be with others, between striking you as charming and coming off as unbearable. Why do I struggle so much to understand which emotion I am feeling? Why am I so bad at predicting what you will find offensive?</p>\n<p>The Fact makes me part of a group of people whose boundaries are amorphous; we do not all recognize one another, and even when we do, we are not sure what we have in common. You would like to manage this situation in a very specific way: First, carve off what you take to be the \u201cmost severe cases,\u201d and find a cure that prevents any more of them from arising.</p>\n<p>Second, assimilate the rest \u2014 people like me \u2014 as \u201cnormal,\u201d or as normal enough, so long as you are sufficiently tolerant and accommodating. But I suspect all the tolerance and accommodation in the world won\u2019t make me normal. Do we have to pretend that I am? Is that the condition on which you are willing to engage with me?

                "body": "<p>Imitation is the best kind of flattery. All creative people, whether they be writers, artists, dancers, singers or actors, know that. Think about the performers on a TV show like \u201cThe Voice,\u201d who sometimes perform the song of a judge they are targeting. Sometimes, it is imitation that gets them on the team of their dreams. It is the same with poetry. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Once you decide to write a poem, it often feels as if you are on a quest for the perfect word, the perfect image, or the perfect idea. In many ways a poem is a treasure and the writing of a poem is a dangerous treasure hunt. You never know what you might happen upon once you start writing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at a kind of poem called the cento. Cento is a Latin word, meaning \u201cpatchwork.\u201d A cento is crafted from \u201cstolen\u201d or found sources. Each line in a cento is taken from a source and putting these lines together weaves them into a patchwork of lines.</p>\n<p>Many people think of the cento as a sort of \u201ccollage-poem.\u201d A collage is made by combining images, texts and textures of different mediums and sizes. Similarly, a cento is created by patching together many found lines to create a poem.</p>\n<p>Of course, stealing is terrible and every artist must give credit where credit is due, so at the bottom of every cento is a note where the writer lists the names of his or her source texts in the order that they appear in the lines of the poem.</p>\n<p>For your cento, you will be using the At Home section to create a poem of five to seven lines. Your lines can be phrases from articles, headlines, quotes or even photo captions. To cut and paste your cento, follow the steps below. </p>\n<p>The hunt </p>\n<p>Hunt, or skim through the paper for lines that speak to you. Maybe your eye will settle on a sentence that uses interesting language, like a vibrant verb or a compelling adjective; maybe you will find a sentence that includes a description of an image you admire, or maybe you will find a line that refers to something that resonates with you, like a mention of a season, a color or an emotion. Keep hunting for your treasured lines. You may already have a topic in mind, or your topic may come to you once you have your lines cut out and you really examine them.</p>\n<p>Keep track</p>\n<p> Though this poem will be your own creation, the lines are not. Take out a piece of paper, or you can use a laptop or phone and write each line down and then write down the author of the article that line came from. You will need this later.</p>\n<p>Thieve (or Cut)</p>\n<p>If you are working from the print newspaper, cut out the lines you have found and place them on a flat surface. Or copy them to a document on your phone. </p>\n<p>Connect</p>\n<p>Look at your individual lines and start playing around with their order, as you stretch them out like snippets of yarn on a table or floor. Could one line jump off another? If so, put that pair to the side. Keep finding connections. Imagine these stolen lines to be threads you are weaving together in meaning, image or emotion.</p>\n<p>Layout</p>\n<p>Once you have laid out your lines, think about how to put them together. If you are still deciding what your poem is about, perhaps focus on an emotion, a place or an image. Your topic is up to you. Let these borrowed words spark something creative inside you.</p>\n<p>When you\u2019re ready, decide what line you want to start with and what line you want to end with. Laying these lines out as a frame will get you motivated. Then, start laying out your other lines. If something seems wrong, move it around, or cut it. You may even want to look for another line to substitute for it.</p>\n<p>Paste</p>\n<p>Paste your lines on paper or on a document, and you have your cento. Make sure to carefully write out, or type your sources.</p>\n<p>Congratulations. You have now written a cento with the generous help of others!</p>\n<p>Sources for Leah Umansky\u2019s cento, drawn from the Nov. 8 issue of At Home: At Home cover, Courtney Rubin, Anna Goldfarb, Tara Parker-Pope, Joseph Burns, Anna Goldfarb, Anna Goldfarb</p>"

                "subheadline": "Business groups and major companies like Apple have been pressing Congress to alter legislation cracking down on imports of goods made with forced labor from persecuted Muslim minorities in China.",
                "byline": "By Ana Swanson",
                "body": "<p>WASHINGTON \u2014 Nike and Coca-Cola are among the major companies and business groups lobbying Congress to weaken a bill that would ban imported goods made with forced labor in China\u2019s Xinjiang region, according to congressional staff members and other people familiar with the matter, as well as lobbying records that show vast spending on the legislation.</p>\n<p>The bill, which would prohibit broad categories of certain goods made by persecuted Muslim minorities in an effort to crack down on human rights abuses, has gained bipartisan support, passing the House in September by a margin of 406 to 3. Congressional aides say it has the backing to pass the Senate, and could be signed into law by either the Trump administration or the incoming Biden administration.</p>\n<p>But the legislation, called the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, has become the target of multinational companies including Apple whose supply chains touch the far western Xinjiang region, as well as of business groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Lobbyists have fought to water down some of its provisions, arguing that while they strongly condemn forced labor and current atrocities in Xinjiang, the act\u2019s ambitious requirements could wreak havoc on supply chains that are deeply embedded in China.</p>\n<p>Xinjiang produces vast amounts of raw materials like cotton, coal, sugar, tomatoes and polysilicon, and supplies workers for China\u2019s apparel and footwear factories. Human rights groups and news reports have linked many multinational companies to suppliers there, including tying Coca-Cola to sugar sourced from Xinjiang, and documenting Uighur workers in a factory in Qingdao that makes Nike shoes.</p>\n<p>In a report issued in March, the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, a bipartisan group of lawmakers, listed Nike and Coca-Cola as companies suspected of ties to forced labor in Xinjiang, alongside Adidas, Calvin Klein, Campbell Soup Company, Costco, H&M, Patagonia, Tommy Hilfiger and others.</p>\n<p>In a statement, Coca-Cola said that it \u201cstrictly prohibits any type of forced labor in our supply chain\u201d and uses third-party auditors to closely monitor its suppliers. It also said that the COFCO Tunhe facility in Xinjiang, which supplies sugar to a local bottling facility and had been linked to allegations of forced labor by The Wall Street Journal and Chinese-language news media, \u201csuccessfully completed an audit in 2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>Greg Rossiter, the director of global communications at Nike, said the company \u201cdid not lobby against\u201d the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act but instead had \u201cconstructive discussions\u201d with congressional staff aides aimed at eliminating forced labor and protecting human rights.</p>\n<p>Asked about the allegations of forced labor, Nike referred to a statement in March in which it said that it did not source products from Xinjiang and that it had confirmed that its suppliers were not using textiles or yarn from the region.</p>\n<p>Nike said that the Qingdao factory had stopped hiring new workers from Xinjiang in 2019, and that an independent audit confirmed there were no longer employees from there at the facility. (According to a report published in March by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute that cited state media, the factory employed around 800 Uighur workers at the end of 2019 and produced more than seven million pairs of shoes for Nike each year.)</p>\n<p>China\u2019s vast campaign of suppressing and forcibly assimilating Uighurs and other minorities in Xinjiang has attracted the scorn of politicians and consumers around the world.</p>\n<p>But for many companies, fully investigating and eliminating any potential ties to forced labor there has been difficult, given the opacity of Chinese supply chains and the limited access of auditors to a region where the Chinese government tightly restricts people\u2019s movements.</p>\n<p>The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act would require companies sending goods to the United States to scrutinize those supply chains, or perhaps abandon Chinese suppliers altogether. It would impose high standards, barring imports of goods made \u201cin whole or in part\u201d in Xinjiang unless companies prove to customs officials that their products were not made with forced labor.</p>\n<p>The bill also targets so-called poverty alleviation and pairing programs that ship Muslims from impoverished areas to work in factories elsewhere, which human rights groups say are often coercive. Companies would be required to disclose information on their ties to Xinjiang to the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>\n<p>Richard A. Mojica, a lawyer at Miller & Chevalier, said that for many companies, convincing the authorities that they have no involvement with forced labor could take months. Firms were already responding by trying to find sources for products outside Xinjiang, he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cRebutting a presumption of forced labor is going to be a very challenging endeavor,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Companies and groups lobbying on the bill have been pushing for various revisions, including easing disclosure requirements, people familiar with the conversations said.</p>\n<p>Apple, which has extensive business ties to China, has also lobbied to limit some provisions of the bill, said two congressional staff members and another person familiar with the matter.</p>\n<p>Disclosure forms show that Apple paid Fierce Government Relations, a firm led by former staff aides to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and President George W. Bush, $90,000 to lobby on issues including Xinjiang-related legislation in the third quarter. Apple\u2019s lobbying was previously reported by The Washington Post.</p>\n<p>Apple also paid outside firms this year to lobby on another bill, the Uyghur Forced Labor Disclosure Act of 2020.</p>\n<p>Apple disputed the claim that it had tried to weaken the legislation, saying it supported efforts to strengthen American regulations and believes the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act should become law.</p>\n<p>According to a document viewed by The New York Times, Apple\u2019s suggested edits to the bill included extending some deadlines for compliance, releasing certain information about supply chains to congressional committees rather than to the public, and requiring Chinese entities to be \u201cdesignated by the United States government\u201d as helping to surveil or detain Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang.</p>\n<p>In its March report, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute identified Apple and Nike among 82 companies that potentially benefited, directly or indirectly, from abusive labor transfer programs tied to Xinjiang.</p>\n<p>That report said that O-Film Technology, a contractor for Apple, Microsoft, Google and other companies, received at least 700 Uighur workers in a program that was expected to \u201cgradually alter their ideology.\u201d It tied other Apple suppliers, including Foxconn Technology, to similar employment programs.</p>\n<p>Apple said in a statement that it had the strongest supplier code of conduct in its industry and that it regularly assessed suppliers, including with surprise audits.</p>\n<p>\u201cLooking for the presence of forced labor is part of every supplier assessment we conduct and any violations of our policies carry immediate consequences, including business termination,\u201d the statement said. \u201cEarlier this year, we conducted a detailed investigation with our suppliers in China and found no evidence of forced labor on Apple production lines and we are continuing to monitor this closely.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lobbying disclosures show that companies have spent heavily to sway Congress on Xinjiang-related legislation, though they reveal nothing about their specific requests.</p>\n<p>In the first three quarters of 2020, Nike spent $920,000 on in-house lobbying of Congress and other federal agencies. Disclosures do not break down expenditures by topic, but show Nike lobbied on matters including physical education grants, taxes and climate change, as well as the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act.</p>\n<p>Nike also paid outside firms like Cornerstone Government Affairs, Ogilvy, Capitol Counsel, GrayRobinson, American Continental Group, DiNino Associates and Empire Consulting Group more than $400,000 this year to lobby on issues including the act.</p>\n<p>Mr. Rossiter said that Nike had these firms on retainer long before the Xinjiang legislation was introduced, and that the company actively worked with lobbying firms to engage Congress on a variety of subjects it cares about.</p>\n<p>Coca-Cola has also invested heavily, spending $4.68 million in the first three quarters of 2020 on in-house lobbying and hiring Empire Consulting Group and Sidley Austin to lobby on issues including the act.</p>\n<p>Coca-Cola said in a statement that it complies with all laws associated with its political activities and has \u201cadopted best-in-class disclosures practices.\u201d</p>\n<p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce declined to comment on lobbying, instead providing a letter it sent to Congress in November with seven other industry groups. The letter said the groups had long been working to combat forced labor, and urged the government to take a comprehensive approach that would mobilize the administration, Congress and foreign governments to address the problem, in addition to industry.</p>"

                "body": "<p>Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.</p>\n<p>INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 For a reporter on an assignment, there\u2019s a time to be a bystander, observing from a distance to better keep an objective perspective on events.</p>\n<p>And then there\u2019s a time to paint.</p>\n<p>I was all set to write a story on the opening of the \u201cBob Ross Experience,\u201d a permanent exhibit and painting workshop series in Indiana, on a recent weekend, without ever picking up a brush. But the course of events had other plans.</p>\n<p>I had been looking forward to the assignment ever since I pitched it to my editor in September \u2014 I would attend the opening of the exhibit, a celebration of the late artist and his beloved PBS show, \u201cThe Joy of Painting,\u201d which inspired amateurs to create their own masterpieces. And there, in the city of Muncie, where Ross filmed nearly all of the show\u2019s 403 episodes, I would take it all in while staying six feet from his dozens of fans \u2014 some sporting Afros and wearing \u201chappy little clouds\u201d masks \u2014 and their collection of easels, canvases and brushes.</p>\n<p>The morning began amicably: I watched a dozen masked painters try to recreate \u201cGray Mountain,\u201d a vibrant landscape from a 1992 episode of the show, in a three-hour workshop led by an instructor. I watched the peaks take shape from individual strokes, until the dozen canvases \u2014 at least from my vantage point at the back of the room \u2014 could pass for Ross originals.</p>\n<p>Maybe anyone really can do this, I thought. I smiled, secure in the knowledge I\u2019d never have to try myself.</p>\n<p>But then, an hour later, at a five-minute mini-workshop in which an instructor taught fans to create their own \u201chappy little trees,\u201d the moment of truth came. The instructor, Ted Simpson, knew I was covering the event and walked up to me with a white 4 by 4 canvas square in hand. I knew what he wanted before he opened his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what they say about the best reporters \u2026\u201d he began.</p>\n<p>I braced myself. I considered: Was I really scared of a happy little tree?</p>\n<p>I dropped my coat in the corner. And I picked up a brush.</p>\n<p>I should clarify: It was not the act of painting itself that I objected to \u2014 I took drawing classes in high school by choice, and even won a couple of awards. But after spending the previous week bingeing episodes of \u201cThe Joy of Painting,\u201d in which Ross repeatedly assured viewers that \u201cit\u2019s just that easy,\u201d I wondered what it would say about me if it wasn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>At first, my fears were realized: I couldn\u2019t even hold the brush properly. I was stabbing at the pools of paint and lifting the brush straight up as though staking a vampire, when I needed to drag it through the globs as if petting a dog.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet the brush do the work for you,\u201d Mr. Simpson told me. (I had flashbacks to cooking with my mom growing up, trying to pierce the casing of the raw Italian sausage that I was slicing with one cut rather than working the knife back and forth. \u201cLet the knife do the work,\u201d she told me then.)</p>\n<p>Then came the time to put the paint on the canvas. \u201cLittle tiny taps, almost like a zigzag,\u201d Mr. Simpson said. But I was still wielding the brush like a pen, jabbing it into the canvas as if it were the chest of someone who had offended me on the playground.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right, there we go,\u201d he said, dragging his own brush dipped in dark green paint across the bottom of my canvas. \u201cYou\u2019ve got it.\u201d (Despite the fact that very clearly, I had not gotten it, or his brush would not be on my canvas.)</p>\n<p>A few minutes later \u2014 after carving my initials into the bottom left corner with a knife in letters that looked as if they came from a 4-year-old \u2014 I was staring at my own happy little tree, which looked respectable, until you saw the model. Side by side, it suddenly looked like something Charlie Brown would bring home for Christmas.</p>\n<p>But back in my Indianapolis apartment later that week, I looked across the room at my tree and realized: That didn\u2019t matter.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo me, that\u2019s what\u2019s so fantastic about painting: Each and every person will paint differently,\u201d Ross once said. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes it special.\u201d</p>\n<p>It may seem like a small thing, but putting down my notebook and picking up a brush helped me better understand the event and Ross\u2019s fans. After all, the exhibit was called an \u201cexperience.\u201d</p>\n<p>In reporting, no two stories are exactly alike, and approaching them that way can deprive readers of a richer reading experience. Kind of like what Bob himself preached about art.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf we all painted the same way, hmm, what a boring time it would be.\u201d</p>"

This is what he has always been: a liar, a con man and a grifter.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider a period in his life 30 years ago, in 1990, and you will see that everything he is doing now he did then. His brazen play at fact alteration isn\u2019t innovation but regurgitation.</p>\n<p>New York City was just coming off the racially divisive Central Park Five case in which five young Black and brown teenagers were wrongly convicted of attacking a white female jogger in Central Park. After the attack, Trump took out a full-page newspaper ad calling for New York State to adopt the death penalty and said of the teens in a CNN interview:</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I hate these people. And, let\u2019s all hate these people because maybe hate is what we need if we\u2019re going to get something done.\u201d</p>\n<p>In early 1990, Trump and his wife at the time, Ivana, separated and went through a messy divorce based on Ivana\u2019s claim of \u201ccruel and inhumane treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p>The author Harry Hurt III wrote in his 1993 book, \u201cLost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump,\u201d that Ivana asserted during a deposition in the 1990 divorce that Trump had assaulted her.</p>\n<p>As The Daily Beast summarized in 2019: \u201cAfter a painful scalp reduction surgery to remove a bald spot, Donald Trump confronted his then-wife, who had previously used the same plastic surgeon.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Daily Beast continued:\u201cDonald held back Ivana\u2019s arms and began to pull out fistfuls of hair from her scalp, as if to mirror the pain he felt from his own operation. He tore off her clothes and unzipped his pants.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018Then he jams his penis inside her for the first time in more than sixteen months. Ivana is terrified \u2026 It is a violent assault,\u2019 Hurt writes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ivana Trump has strenuously objected to this interpretation of events.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Donald Trump\u2019s casino business was floundering.</p>\n<p>As The Atlantic reported in 2017:</p>\n<p>\u201cIn 1990, with Trump Taj Mahal in trouble, Trump\u2019s father Fred strolled in and bought 700 chips worth a total of $3.5 million. The purchase helped the casino pay debt that was due, but because Fred Trump had no plans to gamble, the New Jersey gaming commission ruled that it was a loan that violated operating rules. Trump paid a $30,000 fine; in the end, the loan didn\u2019t prevent a bankruptcy the following year. As noted above, New Jersey also fined Trump $200,000 for arranging to keep Black employees away from mafioso Robert LiButti\u2019s gambling table.\u201d</p>\n<p>And The New York Times reported on Aug 16, 1990, that Trump\u2019s supposed wealth was underwater. According to The Times: \u201cDonald J. Trump\u2019s accountants and bankers have concluded that his empire is worth far less than he contended late last year \u2014 and that if he had been forced to sell his assets this spring he might not have realized enough money to get out of debt.\u201d</p>\n<p>Still, that August, Trump sits with Barbara Walters for a \u201c20/20\u201d interview for his new book, \u201cTrump: Surviving at the Top.\u201d In the interview, Trump begins by attacking the press:</p>\n<p>\u201cWhether it\u2019s a marriage, by the way, or whether it\u2019s financial, I\u2019ve never seen press reporting as I have with regard to me. And, I hope the general public understands how inherently dishonest the press in this country is.\u201d</p>\n<p>Trump then goes on to try to spin Walters \u2014 who would not be spun \u2014 on how his teetering on the edge of bankruptcy should actually be seen as success.</p>\n<p>In the middle of the interview, Walters put this to Trump: \u201cIn your book you say, \u2018Success is so often a matter of perception.\u2019 What do you think the perception of you is today?\u201d</p>\n<p>Trump responds: \u201cI really don\u2019t know what the perception is. I think people see me as a fighter. I think people have always seen me as a fighter. They know that I don\u2019t take a lot of crap from people, and from others.\u201d</p>\n<p>That is what it\u2019s always about for Trump, then as now: perception, not reality. He doesn\u2019t want to be perceived as a loser, even if he is. He doesn\u2019t want to be perceived as a racist, even if he is. He will bend heaven and earth to create an amenable reality when the real reality is counter to his conception of self.</p>\n<p>The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

                "body": "<p>President Trump\u2019s critics warn that history will look unkindly on his effort to overturn a democratic election. This forecast, while understandable, may be wrong. History rarely looks on one-term presidents at all.</p>\n<p>For the last four years I\u2019ve covered his administration as a journalist while also researching and writing books about 19th-century American history. This made it natural to try assessing him from a distance, as future historians might peer at him. Someday the clamor of his tenure will fade, leaving behind a few essential facts, the first of which is his single term.</p>\n<p>Few presidents who served four years or less find an enduring place in the popular imagination. One term is not long to influence a country so large and dynamic \u2014 and a president\u2019s failure to win a second term can be a sign that he didn\u2019t. If you are not from Indiana, you may not know my state produced Benjamin Harrison, a one-term president who was different from President William Henry Harrison, who died after one month in office. Few people visit the statue of James Buchanan in a lonely corner of a Washington park, and in my life I have met just one enthusiast for Chester A. Arthur.</p>\n<p>One-term presidents who escape obscurity often did something beyond the presidency \u2014 like John Adams, one of the nation\u2019s founders, or Jimmy Carter, whose much-admired post-presidency has lasted 10 times as long as his term. John F. Kennedy\u2019s legacy rests, in part, on legislative achievements that passed after his assassination. Others are known for their failures while in office: Warren G. Harding for a corruption scandal, Herbert Hoover for economic calamity, Andrew Johnson for being impeached.</p>\n<p>We can\u2019t be sure what history will make of Mr. Trump, whose term featured scandal, impeachment and calamity, as well as a pandemic. His story may not be over; he remains at the head of a powerful movement, and reportedly talks of running in 2024. But to judge by information available today, he has a relatively narrow role in the American story: as the reaction to a game-changing president \u2014 Barack Obama.</p>\n<p>Something like this is true of many presidents. A relative handful enact lasting change, while others respond to them. The ones who left a mark include Andrew Jackson, Mr. Trump\u2019s favorite, who served two terms, from 1829 to 1837. Jackson founded the Democratic Party, reinforced slavery, pursued populist economic policies, and faced down a near-rebellion over states\u2019 rights. When he exceeded his power to achieve his goals, critics called him King Andrew.</p>\n<p>Jackson was followed by eight presidents who served in his shadow, two of whom died in office and none of whom went on to a second term. History does not linger long on most of them; they were subordinate characters, mostly shaped by Jackson\u2019s agenda \u2014 either advancing or resisting it.</p>\n<p>In the same way, Mr. Trump\u2019s place in history may be overshadowed by Mr. Obama\u2019s. Elected in 2008, Mr. Obama seemed to personify America\u2019s growing diversity as a multiracial republic. His campaign motivated new voters, and he talked at first of transcending old political divisions. He said he wanted Americans to regain trust in institutions battered by 9/11, the war in Iraq and the financial crisis. He raised taxes on the wealthiest Americans, signed the Affordable Care Act, tried to break an impasse over immigration and approved a nuclear agreement to ease a long-running conflict with Iran.</p>\n<p>He also did not manage to transcend the old divisions. Facing unrelenting opposition from Republicans in Congress, he enraged them by using executive authority to govern around them. Numerous Republicans claimed Mr. Obama had acted like a king.</p>\n<p>The Obama presidency paved the way for Mr. Trump. He rose by relentlessly attacking Mr. Obama, promoting the racist conspiracy theory about his birthplace and falsely claiming that he favored open borders. Mr. Trump told voters in 2016 that he was their \u201clast chance\u201d to win before they were overwhelmed by immigration and globalism.</p>\n<p>It is astonishing to recall how much Mr. Trump devoted his term to re-fighting the battles of the Obama years. Using executive authority as Mr. Obama had, he rolled back housing and environmental regulations, reversed transgender rights in the military, and branded antiracism programs as racist.</p>\n<p>But on many issues he only partly succeeded. He withdrew the United States from the Iran nuclear agreement, but other nations did their best to maintain it. He abandoned Mr. Obama\u2019s strategy toward China, but he struggled to make his own strategy work. He damaged the Affordable Care Act but never managed to repeal it, even when his party controlled Congress.</p>\n<p>It was revealing that he publicly supported the most popular benefits of the health insurance law that he said he despised, such as protections for pre-existing conditions. His predecessor defined what health insurance should cover, and Mr. Trump accepted the definition.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump withdrew from the Paris climate accord, but his successor plans to rejoin it. Mr. Trump ended Mr. Obama\u2019s program giving legal status to some undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States as children, but the Supreme Court restored it, finding Mr. Trump\u2019s action \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d Though Mr. Trump took other actions to limit immigration, the most permanent symbol of his policy may be an unfinished wall in the desert. He neither erased all of President Obama\u2019s accomplishments nor completed his own.</p>\n<p>President Trump still has a legacy. He attracted a vast and loyal following. The tax cuts he approved could last for years, while the three conservative justices he appointed are likely to remain on the Supreme Court for decades. His obsessive use of social media made him unlike any president before him, as did his open disregard of barriers between his public duties and personal business. He spoke well of authoritarian rulers, and accelerated the use of disinformation.</p>\n<p>The epic conflicts he generated seem like perfect material for future history classes. It is easy to imagine a high school history book recounting the monthslong court fight over his effort to ban Muslims from entering the United States, followed by discussion on religious freedom and the Constitution.</p>\n<p>But in those same textbooks, President Trump may be a minor player in the larger story of a democracy grappling with demands for a more equal society \u2014 an era marked by the election of Mr. Obama, the first Black president.</p>\n<p>And Mr. Trump\u2019s tenure already has a fitting bookend: On Jan. 20, he will be replaced by Mr. Obama\u2019s vice president.</p>\n<p>Steve Inskeep is a co-host of NPR\u2019s Morning Edition and Up First, and the author of \u201cJacksonland\u201d and \u201cImperfect Union: How Jessie and John Fremont Mapped the West, Invented Celebrity, and Helped Cause the Civil War.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

                "headline": "Finding Hope When Things Feel Gloomy",
                "subheadline": "Creating hope may be an uphill climb, but there are ways to get there.",
                "byline": "By Jenny Taitz",
                "body": "<p>In my practice as a clinical psychologist, on more days than not, I hear some version of this plea: \u201cHow can I feel hopeful without deluding myself?\u201d</p>\n<p>I get it. While helping appropriately skeptical people build meaningful lives, I never want to sugarcoat the state of the world. Feeling frustration and pain makes sense during this unnerving time.</p>\n<p>Yet there is still room for hope, which isn\u2019t a flimsy feeling or about convincing yourself that things will improve. Hope is an action-filled process \u2014 and I teach my patients to look at it that way, too. According to a renowned hope researcher, Dr. Charles Snyder, who was a professor in psychology at the University of Kansas, hope arises when you identify paths to approach your goals alongside a willingness to persevere despite obstacles.</p>\n<p>When you equate hope with empowering behaviors, it doesn\u2019t feel optimistic so much as realistic.</p>\n<p>But even when pursuing hope feels unnatural, it can be liberating. Maintaining hope when facing challenges predicts both emotional and physical resilience, while hopelessness, or the combination of experiencing negative life events and believing you\u2019re powerless, fuels depression.</p>\n<p>\u201cHope is a psychological stabilizer \u2014 it protects our well-being from stressful events,\u201d said Mark Manson, an author who writes about hope and happiness.</p>\n<p>Even if you feel emotionally depleted now, research suggests that it\u2019s possible to consciously and systematically increase hope. In analyzing dozens of studies on brief hope interventions in older adults, Silvia Hernandez, a doctoral candidate at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, said cognitive behavioral therapies can significantly improve hope in people struggling with depression, health and bereavement.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe know that if we can help a person bear the storm, they will eventually see sunlight,\u201d Ms. Hernandez said. \u201cHolding onto the smallest sliver of hope can be enough to pull us through and ultimately save a life.\u201d</p>\n<p>Here are some of my favorite ways to spark and maintain hope in hard times.</p>\n<h2>Control what you can</h2>\n<p>While you should allow yourself to experience a certain amount of distress and mourning, step away from the urge to give up entirely. When crises in the world at large feel out of your control, thinking about the various components of your life \u2014 and setting small, specific goals to improve them \u2014 can help reduce feelings of helplessness.</p>\n<p>\u201cI remember the values, like kindness and compassion, that form the North Star I try to navigate my life by, and keep in touch with their importance through the turmoil and uncertainty and anxiety of life right now,\u201d said Sharon Salzberg, a mindfulness teacher and the author of \u201cReal Change: Mindfulness to Heal Ourselves and the World.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoing this gives my life a cohesive path that feels like it is onward leading,\u201d she said.</p>\n<h2>Swap microaggressions for \u2018micro-progressions\u2019</h2>\n<p>If it feels overwhelming to think about how to take steps forward right now, try noticing small opportunities in what Cory Newman, director of the Center for Cognitive Therapy at the University of Pennsylvania, calls \u201cmicro-progressions.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cContrary to microaggressions, which are small but hurtful and accumulative comments or actions that show insensitivity toward persons who are not in the \u2018white privilege camp,\u2019 micro-progressions are small actions that communicate respect,\u201d Dr. Newman said.</p>\n<p>While these deliberate behaviors don\u2019t undo inequalities, they are steps in the direction of beginning emotional reparations.</p>\n<p>\u201cMicro-progressions are best delivered without any announcement, as if they are not special, but just normal,\u201d Dr. Newman said. \u201cAn example would be resisting an urge to comment in a meeting while a person of color who has not yet finished speaking continues to have the floor.\u201d</p>\n<h2>Work on your mental agility</h2>\n<p>Remember that a key facet of hope is creatively problem-solving when obstacles arise. Plan ways to move forward rather than shutting down when stressors come up. Similar to athletes who anticipate \u201chitting a wall,\u201d rehearse pushing past fatigue. If you strategize before you\u2019re drained, you can keep going.</p>\n<p>Of course, shifting from feeling as if there are no options to actively brainstorming and executing ideas takes practice. It can be tough to get past all-or-nothing thinking. In cognitive psychology, there\u2019s a bias known as functional fixedness, where people become locked into seeing only one use for common objects, even when that\u2019s not the case. One example I use with clients is peanut butter: While it\u2019s a spread for a sandwich, it can also be used to remove gum from your hair. In the same way, thinking resourcefully may not come easily, but if you let yourself think out of the box, you may find surprising solutions.</p>\n<p>So take a moment to anticipate thoughts or urges that haunt you, like, \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d or notice when you\u2019re itching to give something up, then imagine how you might shift your inner soundtrack, perhaps by seeing these thoughts as visitors you don\u2019t have to take too seriously. You can also list thoughts that hijack you, each on its own index card, then shuffle through them casually (e.g. \u201cWhy bother?\u201d) as you continue to sit with your emotions and move toward pursuing meaningful actions.</p>\n<h2>Consider what is still true for you</h2>\n<p>In the midst of so much pain, it\u2019s possible to consciously notice what hasn\u2019t been broken by all the disruption and change. Ms. Salzberg practices and prescribes reflecting on the question, \u201cWhat\u2019s still true?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you can find something intact, whole, unbroken, it will give you hope,\u201d she said. \u201cIt might be the life reflected in a child\u2019s smile or a puppy\u2019s antics. It might be nature; it might be fundamental beliefs in things like the power of love.\u201d</p>\n<p>One thing that never changes is that it\u2019s impossible to predict the future. Instead of expecting that everything will go terribly, shift into a more open state of mind. Curiosity helps interrupt despair, Dr. Newman said.</p>\n<p>Added Mr. Manson: \u201cFew of the challenges we face today are historically unique and most of the long-term trends show that the world is continuing to get better.\u201d</p>\n<h2>Build a hope kit</h2>\n<p>Gathering uplifting photos, music, mementos and a list of practices that inspire you can help you access the motivation to keep going when you need a boost. While this may seem superficial, one study showed that creating a hope collection significantly increased hope in patients with terminal cancer.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo to the park, remove your shoes, and feel the grass,\u201d advised Juan Carlos Ruiz, a pastor at the Lutheran Church of the Good Shepherd in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. Over the course of the pandemic, Mr. Ruiz has provided funerals and burials for many undocumented individuals, at no cost to their families. To bolster his hope, he similarly anchors himself with nature.</p>\n<p>Creating hope takes willingness and ongoing effort, like an uphill climb, yet ultimately leads to enjoying an improved perspective \u2014 not to mention awe-inspiring views.</p>"

                "subheadline": "In the White House and elsewhere, the president-elect\u2019s selections are heavy on labor economists and champions of organized labor.",
                "byline": "By Jim Tankersley, Jeanna Smialek and Alan Rappeport",
                "body": "<p>WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. formally announced his top economic advisers on Monday, choosing a team that is stocked with champions of organized labor and marginalized workers, signaling an early focus on efforts to speed and spread the gains of the recovery from the pandemic recession.</p>\n<p>The selections build on a pledge Mr. Biden made to business groups two weeks ago, when he said labor unions would have \u201cincreased power\u201d in his administration. They suggest that Mr. Biden\u2019s team will be focused initially on increased federal spending to reduce unemployment and an expanded safety net to cushion households that have continued to suffer as the coronavirus persists and the recovery slows.</p>\n<p>In a sign that Mr. Biden plans to focus on spreading economic wealth, his transition team put issues of equality and worker empowerment at the forefront of its news release announcing the nominees, saying they would help create \u201can economy that gives every single person across America a fair shot and an equal chance to get ahead.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Biden\u2019s picks include Janet L. Yellen, the former Federal Reserve chair, as Treasury secretary; Cecilia Rouse of Princeton University, to head the White House Council of Economic Advisers; and Neera Tanden of the Center for American Progress think tank, to run the Office of Management and Budget. All three have focused on efforts to increase worker earnings and reduce racial and gender discrimination in the economy.</p>\n<p>Ms. Tanden said in February that rising income inequality was the consequence of \u201cdecades of conservative attacks on workers\u2019 right to organize\u201d and that labor unions \u201care a powerful vehicle to move workers into the middle class and keep them there.\u201d</p>\n<p>The two other nominees to Mr. Biden\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, Jared Bernstein and Heather Boushey, are economists who have pushed for policies to advance workers and labor rights, and who advised Mr. Biden in his campaign as he built an agenda that featured several longstanding goals of organized labor, like raising the federal minimum wage and strengthening \u201cBuy America\u201d requirements in federal contracting.</p>\n<p>Ms. Boushey has also been a vocal advocate of policies to help working families, including providing up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave. In an interview last week, Ms. Boushey said such a policy was especially critical during the pandemic, \u201cwhen lives are at stake.\u201d</p>\n<p>William E. Spriggs, the chief economist for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. labor union, hailed the selections, saying in an email on Monday that \u201cwe have not had a C.E.A. as focused on the role of fiscal policy and full employment since President Johnson.\u201d</p>\n<p>The team has embraced increased federal spending to help households and businesses during the pandemic, a position that was highlighted in an op-ed article that Ms. Tanden and Ms. Boushey wrote with two co-authors in March, urging policymakers to spend big even though it would require borrowing large sums of money.</p>\n<p>\u201cGiven the magnitude of the crisis,\u201d they wrote, \u201cnow is not the time for policymakers to worry about raising deficits and debt as they consider what steps to take.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Biden also named Adewale Adeyemo, a senior international economic adviser in the Obama administration, as deputy Treasury secretary.</p>\n<p>The nominees, who require Senate confirmation, will be introduced on Tuesday. Another of Mr. Biden\u2019s picks, the former Obama adviser Brian Deese, has been tapped to lead the National Economic Council but was not included in Monday\u2019s announcement.</p>\n<p>Mr. Biden\u2019s team includes several labor economists, including Ms. Yellen, who has been a longtime champion of workers and has at times suggested allowing the unemployment rate to run low for a longer period of time without worrying about inflation \u2014 an idea some economists thought imprudent but which has since become more widely accepted. While at the Fed, she balanced her preference for a strong labor market with inflation concerns and political constraints.</p>\n<p>In the early 2000s, Ms. Yellen was instrumental in persuading the Fed\u2019s policy-setting committee to coalesce around targeting a 2 percent inflation rate instead of the zero inflation rate that Alan Greenspan, the Fed chair at the time, originally favored. The Fed raises rates to slow the economy and offset inflationary pressures, so targeting slightly higher inflation opened the door to longer periods of cheap borrowing that can lead to stronger economic demand and lower unemployment.</p>\n<p>As Fed chair from 2014 to 2018, Ms. Yellen favored a patient approach to policy-setting that weighed concerns that prices might heat up as joblessness dropped against a preference for pulling more workers into the labor market.</p>\n<p>In one wonky 2016 speech, she suggested that allowing the labor market to expand without raising interest rates might help to reverse damage by pulling people in from the sidelines and prompting others to look for better jobs. She was criticized for the remarks, and later backed away from such an approach in word if not in deed. She and her colleagues lifted interest rates to fend off inflation pressures, but did so at a very slow pace, prompting criticism. Those rate increases have since been viewed as too aggressive and faulted for prematurely snuffing out a more robust labor market expansion.</p>\n<p>Ms. Yellen also walked a careful line when it came to issues like inequality. In one 2014 speech, she suggested that widening income and wealth inequality might be incompatible with American values \u2014 \u201camong them the high value Americans have traditionally placed on equality of opportunity\u201d \u2014 a remark Republicans criticized.</p>\n<p>Much has changed since Ms. Yellen was at the Fed \u2014 in ways that could allow her to embrace some of her more labor-friendly instincts if she is confirmed to the Treasury. While the Treasury secretary\u2019s direct economic power is somewhat limited, the position holds significant sway as a fiscal policy adviser to Congress and the president, as well as oversight of tax policy through the Internal Revenue Service.</p>\n<p>Inflation, once seen as a real and looming threat, has been low for more than a decade. Inequality, once labeled a political and liberal issue, is increasingly recognized as a real economic constraint by Democrats and Republicans alike.</p>\n<p>Yet some progressive groups have raised concerns that Mr. Biden\u2019s team could pivot too quickly to try to reduce the federal budget deficit once the pandemic subsides, citing past comments by Ms. Yellen and Ms. Tanden.</p>\n<p>Economists on the left have become increasingly comfortable with deficit spending, and Ms. Yellen has long favored government intervention as a way to get the economy going during times of trouble. But she has also said America\u2019s debt load is unsustainable, and has generally favored taxation as an offset to increased spending.</p>\n<p>Mr. Biden, too, has expressed support for borrowing money to aid the current recovery, but sought to offset the cost of other economic proposals \u2014 like an infrastructure bill and actions to mitigate climate change \u2014 with tax increases on high earners and corporations.</p>\n<p>In a 2018 interview at the Charles Schwab Impact conference in Washington, Ms. Yellen said the U.S. debt path was \u201cunsustainable\u201d and offered a remedy: \u201cIf I had a magic wand, I would raise taxes and cut retirement spending.\u201d Last year, she described the need to overhaul the nation\u2019s social safety net programs as \u201croot canal economics.\u201d</p>\n<p>But Ms. Yellen has made clear that she does not see deficit reduction as a priority during the current crisis and that the federal government should spend what is necessary to weather the pandemic. In July, she testified before Congress with Ben S. Bernanke, another former Fed chair, and called for substantial federal support.</p>\n<p>\u201cWith interest rates extremely low and likely to remain so for some time, we do not believe that concerns about the deficit and debt should prevent the Congress from responding robustly to this emergency,\u201d she said. \u201cThe top priorities at this time should be protecting our citizens from the pandemic and pursuing a stronger and equitable economic recovery.\u201d</p>\n<p>Many Republicans, however, have once again begun warning about the deficit and citing mounting debt levels as a reason to avoid another large virus spending package.</p>\n<p>Bridging those concerns will fall to both Ms. Yellen and Ms. Tanden, whose role as the White House budget director will put her in the center of fiscal fights with Congress.</p>\n<p>Some liberal groups have raised concerns over Ms. Tanden\u2019s 2012 remarks to C-SPAN about potential cuts to safety-net programs as part of a long-term deal to reduce federal debt.</p>\n<p>In that interview with the network, Ms. Tanden said that the restructuring of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid must be \u201con the table\u201d in conversations about long-term deficit reduction and noted that the Center for American Progress had made such proposals.</p>\n<p>But in 2017, as Republicans prepared to approve a $1.5 trillion tax cut, Ms. Tanden showed no desire to return to deficit reduction in a future administration. \u201cThe rule seems to be deficits only matter for Democratic presidents,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cAnd that rule needs to die now. We should not have to clean up their mess.\u201d</p>\n<p>Liberal senators, including Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, cheered the selections of Mr. Biden\u2019s team, including Ms. Yellen and Ms. Tanden. Mr. Brown said on Twitter that Ms. Tanden was \u201csmart, experienced, and qualified\u201d and demanded that Senate Republicans confirm Mr. Biden\u2019s team.</p>\n<p>Republicans did not unite in opposition, though when asked about Ms. Yellen, Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, criticized her as being a \u201cgood example of the corporate liberals.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s somebody who clearly has done the bidding of the big multinational corporations,\u201d he said. \u201cHer record on trade is astoundingly terrible.\u201d</p>\n<p>Liberal economists welcomed the picks. \u201cThere are reasons to be hopeful,\u201d said Stephanie Kelton, a professor at Stony Brook University and the author of the book \u201cThe Deficit Myth,\u201d which makes a case that budget deficits are not inherently bad.</p>\n<p>Ms. Kelton helped with economic agenda-setting during the Biden campaign as a task force member, and said the fact that people like Mr. Bernstein and Ms. Boushey were included among the economic thinkers was a reason to hope that progressive ideals would have a voice at the table. That said, Ms. Kelton said she remained wary that there would be continued attention to deficits and deficit reduction.</p>"

                "body": "<p>Warning that New York had entered a \u201cnew phase in the war against Covid,\u201d Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Monday that the state will implement a barrage of new emergency actions, some of which echo the strict measures taken this spring, to stem a rising tide of infections and deaths.</p>\n<p>Mr. Cuomo said that the strength of the virus\u2019s second wave has forced the state to rely less on test positivity rates as the determinant for restrictions, and focus more on hospital capacity. On Monday, the governor announced that hospitalizations topped 3,500 over the weekend, a level not seen since May.</p>\n<p>The governor said if hospitals become overwhelmed, he could impose a regionally based shutdown, or \u201cpause\u201d order, as he did statewide in the spring. He also asked hospitals to begin identifying retired doctors and nurses to help staff medical facilities, where he said burnout was an increasingly common problem.</p>\n<p>The governor said he wanted to prevent the conditions that led to Elmhurst Hospital in Queens being inundated by coronavirus patients this spring, with beds filled, doctors overworked and refrigerated trucks posted outside to hold the dead.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are not going to live through the nightmare of overwhelmed hospitals again,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said during a briefing in Manhattan.</p>\n<p>Mr. Cuomo said that he would ask hospitals to increase the number of beds by 50 percent, and hospital chains to evaluate where there was capacity inside of those systems, to help redistribute patients where there was availability.</p>\n<p>Plans for field hospitals were being dusted off, the governor said, adding that capacity would also be evaluated between hospitals in different parts of the state, an idea known as \u201csurge-and-flex,\u201d another measure the governor implemented in the spring.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Mr. Cuomo also announced that he was ordering hospitals to stop elective surgery in Erie County, in Western New York, which is currently enduring the highest weekly positive test rates in the state. The county led the state in number of deaths reported on Monday.</p>\n<p>Despite rising rates of infection, Mr. Cuomo has resisted implementing the kind of widespread shutdowns seen in March, when hundreds of New Yorkers began to die every week, and much of New York\u2019s economic activity ground to a complete halt. </p>\n<p>Rather, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s strategy has been to utilize targeted restrictions on individual areas \u2014 known as his \u201cmicro-cluster initiative\u201d \u2014 which has now expanded to nearly 30 locations around the state, including in all five boroughs of New York City, its suburban counties, and major upstate population centers.</p>\n<p>The announcement on Monday came after weeks of steadily more worrying news in New York. The state\u2019s daily rate of positive tests on Sunday topped 4 percent for the first time since May, and the number of more serious cases continued to grow. The positivity rate was reported to be 4.57 percent on Monday.</p>\n<p>The death toll has also started to rise again: On Monday, the governor said 54 deaths were reported by the state. All told, almost 1,000 people died in New York this month, according to The New York Times\u2019s tally, making November the deadliest month since June. The state has suffered more than 34,000 deaths since the discovery of the first case in March 1, the most of any state.</p>\n<p>In his remarks on Monday, Mr. Cuomo noted that the current surge of cases has been more widespread than in the spring, when cases and deaths were largely concentrated in New York City and its suburbs.</p>\n<p>He recalled how some upstate regions sent reinforcements and resources to downstate medical facilities in the spring, and suggested that would be difficult now. \u201cEvery region is dealing with a hospital issue,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Mr. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat, has been touting the state\u2019s response to the crisis for months, releasing a book in October about \u201cleadership lessons\u201d drawn from his experiences. The governor has also repeatedly made a point of saying that New York is doing well in comparison with other states.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, however, the governor seemed to modify his thinking on that point somewhat, saying, while \u201cit\u2019s nice that we\u2019re doing better in a national context,\u201d it is also \u201cirrelevant.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause we have to deal with the issues that we have here in New York relative to New York, right?\u201d Mr. Cuomo said.</p>\n<p>Mr. Cuomo praised efforts by Mayor Bill de Blasio, who appeared at the news conference via Zoom, to reopen elementary schools, while voicing broader support for plans to keep students in kindergarten through eighth grade in classrooms.</p>\n<p>The city will no longer use a 3 percent test positivity threshold that it had adopted for closing the school system; instead, the city will increase testing in schools and close those that have multiple confirmed virus cases.</p>\n<p>And with the state\u2019s daily positivity rate now above 4 percent, Mr. Cuomo \u2014 seemingly aware of how relying solely on rising infection rates could lead to economically detrimental shutdowns \u2014 had been indicating that a statewide shift in strategy was coming.</p>\n<p>On Monday, the governor said new metrics \u2014 including hospitalization rates, death and case rates, and available hospital beds \u2014 would be used to determine lockdown levels under the \u201cmicro-cluster\u201d strategy, the state\u2019s color-coded restriction system. Mr. Cuomo said those new numbers will be set this week, after the state evaluates the effects of people congregating during last week\u2019s Thanksgiving holiday.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve seen the hit from Thanksgiving,\u201d he said, adding that he believed the increase in cases \u201cwill be dramatic.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s still unclear how the governor will reconcile positivity rates and hospital metrics to determine new restrictions, but state officials said homing in on hospitalizations was a useful way to determine the severity of the disease in any given location. There are areas in the state where the number of people testing positive has increased, for example, but hospitalizations have not, lessening the urgency for new restrictions there, officials said.</p>\n<p>With Mr. Cuomo ordering the redistribution of patients across hospitals, the state plans to track hospitalizations by a patient\u2019s home address, not only where the person is hospitalized, to better ascertain which parts of the state are driving hospital admissions.</p>\n<p>Officials said that the governor\u2019s renewed focus on hospital capacity, harkening back to the grim projections of overrun hospitals in the spring, is a deliberate tactic to underscore the severity of the situation and prompt citizens to behave responsibly.</p>\n<p>Indeed, Mr. Cuomo predicted that the rates of infection would continue to rise through December and into January, while still expressing confidence that the state could withstand the second wave.</p>\n<p>State officials believe a majority of new cases in the state stem from small gatherings in homes, with people increasingly congregating indoors as temperatures drop, rather than in public settings like bars and restaurants. Changing that behavior, the governor said, would require a robust public messaging campaign similar to the one employed around mask wearing.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is all in our control,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said.</p>\n<p>Troy Closson contributed reporting.</p>"

                "subheadline": "Foot traffic was down considerably and internet sales surged during a holiday weekend altered by the coronavirus.",
                "byline": "By Sapna Maheshwari and Michael Corkery",
                "body": "<p>The 2020 edition of Black Friday did not offer the usual scenes of bustling stores and shoppers lined up outside discount chains and electronics retailers. Instead, most people bought online, if they bought at all.</p>\n<p>Crowds at malls and city shopping districts were relatively sparse over the holiday weekend in the face of rising coronavirus cases and warnings from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to avoid large groups. Major chains closed on Thanksgiving, after years of being open that day. And many Americans did their shopping before the weekend even began, drawn by sales that began in October.</p>\n<p>Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimated that retailers\u2019 overall Black Friday sales fell 20 percent from last year, based on early reports of drops in store foot traffic and increases in online sales. Consumers spent $9 billion online on Friday, a 21.6 increase from last year and the second-biggest figure for online retailers ever, according to Adobe Analytics, which scans 80 percent of online transactions across the top 100 U.S. web retailers. The firm said online sales rose to $23.5 billion in the four-day Thanksgiving-to-Sunday period, up 23 percent from last year.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t a Black Friday, it was a bleak Friday in stores,\u201d said David Bassuk, global co-head of the retail practice at AlixPartners, a consulting firm. \u201cIt is such a stark contrast to past years. The stores were really ghost towns.\u201d</p>\n<p>The early results from the weekend, which has traditionally kicked off holiday shopping in the United States, show how the season is being upended by the pandemic. Major retailers started offering deals well before Halloween, a shift that was amplified by Amazon\u2019s decision to hold its annual Prime Day event in the middle of October. Consumers have been encouraged to shop early to avoid shipping delays. Chains have replicated deals once limited to stores on their websites and canceled visits with Santa Claus to minimize crowds.</p>\n<p>Americans were already spending online before the pandemic, but the crisis has accelerated the trend. About 59 percent of shoppers had started their holiday shopping by early November this year, the National Retail Federation said. Shopper foot traffic declined 52 percent on Friday, according to data from Sensormatic Solutions.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe ability to pull the holiday forward may linger with us,\u201d said Simeon Siegel, a retail analyst at BMO Capital Markets. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since Black Friday was simply three hours in the morning on Friday. Black Friday was already stretched into early November, it just happened to make it into October as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>During earnings calls in November, several retail executives said they were uncertain about how much holiday shopping had actually been done in October and early November. Matthew Bilunas, chief financial officer at Best Buy, said that \u201cit\u2019s really difficult to predict exactly how much was pulled into\u201d the third quarter.</p>\n<p>Most retailers operate on a calendar where the fourth quarter starts in November and ends in January, in part to fully capture the holiday shopping season.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe think it\u2019s going to be a prolonged shopping season,\u201d Brian Cornell, chief executive of Target, said on a separate call. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see very different shopping patterns. We don\u2019t expect to see those big spikes during Black Friday and on weekends.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sales on Monday \u2014\u00a0known as Cyber Monday since it was concocted in 2005 \u2014\u00a0 are expected to exceed those on Friday.</p>\n<p>But while consumers have flocked to deals online, Mr. Siegel said, many retailers had carefully managed inventory and promotions and were largely holding the line on prices compared with 2019.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeople have become accustomed to doorbusters and ever-deeper promotions,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality is at most companies, the headline promotions are, at most, flat to last year.\u201d</p>\n<p>The bigger question for retailers is how the jump in online sales may eat into their profits, since they have to spend additional money on shipping and processing returns. Black Friday was traditionally considered the day that retailers went from being in the red to becoming profitable, or in the black, for the year.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe idea of retailers moving into the black on Black Friday has also evaporated,\u201d said Mr. Bassuk of Alix Partners. \u201cYes, there is more volume, but as that volume shifts to online, it becomes more costly for the retailers.\u201d</p>\n<p>While the number of shoppers visiting just about every store on Black Friday was down markedly from previous years, those who did venture out were not there to window-shop.</p>\n<p>Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail research firm, said retailers experienced higher \u201cconversion\u201d rates, meaning more shoppers in the stores actually made purchases than in previous years.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a trend we\u2019re expected to see at this Covid Christmas,\u201d Mr. Johnson said in an email.</p>\n<p>While the results of this year have prompted some experts to portend the death of Black Friday, Mr. Siegel is among analysts who view 2020 as an outlier, anticipating that shoppers will return to stores once they feel it is safe to do so.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe pandemic will leave us with a lot of new traditions but it\u2019s not going to wipe away all of the prior,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>The rest of the holiday shopping season will be closely watched as a barometer for the U.S. economy. Millions of people are still out of work or have been forced into part-time employment. Overall consumer spending, which drives as much as two-thirds of economic activity, has slowed in recent months along with the expiration of some emergency government spending programs.</p>"

                "subheadline": "She championed the rights of the Oglala Lakota in South Dakota and was a leader in protests at Wounded Knee and oil pipeline sites.",
                "byline": "By Michael Astor",
                "body": "<p>Debra White Plume, a prominent Native American activist who faced down police bullets, uranium mining companies and oil pipeline projects in trying to protect the traditional Oglala Lakota way of life, died on Nov. 10 in Rapid City, S.D. She was 66.</p>\n<p>The cause was cancer, which was found in her lungs and abdomen, according to her husband, Alex White Plume.</p>\n<p>In 1973, Ms. White Plume was among the first people to join the American Indian Movement\u2019s occupation of Wounded Knee, on the Pine Ridge Reservation in southwest South Dakota, over demands that the U.S. government respect its treaties with Indigenous tribes from the 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>\n<p>The police surrounded the town \u2014 the site of an 1890 massacre by U.S. cavalry troops \u2014 and a 71-day standoff ensued. Both sides traded fire almost nightly, leaving two Native Americans dead and one federal agent paralyzed by a gunshot.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was a moment in time \u2014 there was the women\u2019s movement, there was the civil rights movement, there was the Vietnam War stuff going on, and we just said, \u2018That\u2019s enough for us, too. We\u2019re not going to take this anymore,\u2019\u201d Ms. White Plume said in a videotaped interview in 2016 with the independent news organization Democracy Now!</p>\n<p>But little changed. Today some 20,000 Oglala Lakota eke out a hardscrabble existence on the reservation. Unemployment hovers at about 85 percent, alcoholism is rampant, life expectancy is 30 years below the national average, and treaty rights are routinely ignored.</p>\n<p>Those conditions prompted Ms. White Plume, in 1999, to help found Owe Aku (Bring Back the Way), an advocacy group dedicated to cultural preservation and the protection of Lakota treaty rights through nonviolent direct action. She became its executive director and held that title at her death.</p>\n<p>Ms. White Plume came to see that the biggest challenge facing Native Americans was in protecting their water supply. She and others feared that uranium mining, just outside the reservation, could contaminate water with radioactivity and chemicals like arsenic, used in the extraction process. And they saw two major oil pipelines in the works \u2014 the Keystone XL and the Dakota Access \u2014 as threatening not only ancestral burial sites but also aquifers.</p>\n<p>In 2015, Ms. White Plume was the lead plaintiff in a still unresolved lawsuit to stop the giant uranium mining company Cameco from expanding its operations at Crow Butte, a sacred site across the Nebraska border and within Lakota treaty territories. (The company has suspended its mining there.) And she had a leading role in promoting nonviolent direct action to protest the oil pipelines.</p>\n<p>In 2011 she was arrested outside the White House in Washington during a protest over the Keystone project, a 1,200-mile pipeline that would extend from Alberta, Canada, to Nebraska.</p>\n<p>In 2016, at the Standing Rock Reservation, which straddles North Dakota and South Dakota, she helped establish camps for thousands of occupying protesters who for months had gathered to stop the completion of the 1,172-mile-long Dakota Access Pipeline.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Lakota, I\u2019m a woman, and water is the domain of the women in our nation,\u201d Ms. White Plume said in a video interview at Standing Rock. \u201cAnd so it\u2019s our privilege and our obligation to protect water.\u201d She added, \u201cIf somebody wants to label me, I guess it would be water protector.\u201d</p>\n<p>Debra Richard \u2014 her Lakota name was Wioweya Najin Win \u2014 was born on the Pine Ridge reservation on Aug. 20, 1954. Her father, John Baptiste Reshaw, held a variety of jobs. Her mother, Bernice Ione (Swallow) Stone, who was from the Cheyenne tribe, helped run a shelter for battered women.</p>\n<p>As a youth, Ms. White Plume traveled to California under the Indian Relocation Act of 1956, which encouraged Native Americans to leave their traditional lands and assimilate in urban areas. She attended high school in San Jose for a time but eventually returned to Pine Ridge, where she graduated from Red Cloud High School and Oglala Lakota College.</p>\n<p>The years following the Wounded Knee occupation were a violent time on the reservation, with infighting among its residents and clashes with the police. In the late 1970s, Ms. White Plume, along with her mother and one of her brothers, came under fire outside her home. She suffered a graze wound on her arm, and the others\u2019 wounds were not life-threatening. They never found out who shot them but suspected that the attackers were undercover police officers.</p>\n<p>She married Alex White Plume in 1988, and the couple settled down in a modest house along the banks of Wounded Knee Creek. There they reared their nine children and raised horses and a small herd of buffalo, which they kept for spiritual and cultural purposes.</p>\n<p>The White Plumes gained news media attention in 1998 for planting industrial hemp, one of the few crops that could grow on the reservation, without Drug Enforcement Administration approval. (The crop is a species of cannabis.) Mr. White Plume reasoned that because the reservation was sovereign Lakota territory, federal laws prohibiting hemp farming did not apply. The courts, however, disagreed and ordered the plants destroyed. (Congress legalized production in 2018.)</p>\n<p>Ms. White Plume appears briefly in the Michael Apted documentary \u201cIncident at Oglala\u201d (1992), about the murders of two F.B.I. agents in 1975 and the conviction of the Native American activist Leonard Peltier in the killings. And she is featured in the documentaries \u201cStanding Silent Nation\u201d (2006), about hemp farming, and \u201cCrying Earth Rise Up\u201d (2015), about the dangers of uranium mining.</p>\n<p>In addition to her husband, Ms. White Plume is survived by their children \u2014 Johnny Joe White Plume, Lance Martin, Wacinhin Ska Win Rosebud White Plume, Jessica White Plume, Wiwang Waci Win Camp, Vic Camp, Posh Camp, Dallas White Plume and Sam Tall \u2014 as well as many grandchildren.</p>\n<p>She dedicated her last years to Ama\u2019s Freedom School, which she founded. A school without walls, it teaches traditional Lakota culture outside the regular school system. (Ama means memory in the Lakota language.)</p>\n<p>If Ms. White Plume had mellowed over the years, it was only a little, and her objectives remained the same. Speaking during the Standing Rock protests, she said:</p>\n<p>\u201cI fought with cops before. I\u2019ve been shot at by police. I\u2019ve been shot by police. We got it on with police on Pine Ridge back in the day, so I understand that rage. But when we\u2019re together to protect sacred water, let\u2019s do it with dignity, let\u2019s do it with training, let\u2019s do it with unity.\u201d</p>"

                "subheadline": "Alenka Artnik of Slovenia recently set a record in free diving. But her race to the bottom may not be over.",
                "byline": "By Adam Skolnick",
                "body": "<p>One morning this month, on the warm waters of the Red Sea off the coast of Egypt, Alenka Artnik donned a thin purple wet suit and a monofin, secured a four-pound weight around her neck, and fastened herself to a thin line she held loosely in one hand.</p>\n<p>Then she dived. Deep, with no mask or goggles but with her nostrils clamped. The line extended 114 meters (374 feet) below the surface and, holding her breath, Artnik was determined to get to the bottom of it and come back up under her own power. If successful she would set a new world record.</p>\n<p>This feat was not for the faint of heart, or lung.</p>\n<p>Nicholas Mevoli, the first American to break the 100 meter barrier with a monofin in a so-called free dive, died while attempting to break a second American record in the sport seven years earlier, after surfacing with a lung injury. Natalia Molchanova, a 41-time world-record holder and 23-time world champion \u2014 widely considered the greatest free diver of all time \u2014 vanished during a training dive in Spain less than two years later.</p>\n<p>But after a sleepless night, Artnik, a 39-year-old Slovenian, wasn\u2019t focused on danger or death. She needed to remain present and calm. Just after 8 a.m., Artnik packed her lungs with air and descended, kicking down into the inky blue.</p>\n<p>There are three recognized depth categories in the sport of competitive free diving. In \u201cfree immersion,\u201d athletes pull themselves along a rope down to depth and back without wearing fins. In \u201cconstant no fins,\u201d athletes use a modified breaststroke. In \u201cconstant weight,\u201d the one in which Artnik sought her world record, divers dolphin-kick to depth and back wearing a monofin. It\u2019s the deepest discipline and the most celebrated. Any weights used to help them sink, must return to the surface with them or they will be disqualified.</p>\n<p>In deep water, barometric pressure cranks up roughly every 10 meters, or approximately 33 feet. At 20 meters, Artnik\u2019s lungs were compressed to a third of their normal capacity, so she moved the air she\u2019d need to equalize her sinuses from her lungs into her mouth. That\u2019s what divers call a mouth fill. If any air escapes through their lips, diving deep becomes impossible without injury.</p>\n<p>Involuntary physiological changes were triggered by the pressure as well. As her lungs continued to compress, blood flow shifted from her arms and legs into her core. Her pulse slowed to half her resting rate as her body adapted to use the oxygen in her bloodstream more efficiently, to keep her alert and alive. That\u2019s all part of what scientists have called the mammalian diving reflex, as a similar response occurs in seals, dolphins and whales.</p>\n<p>At 70 meters, Artnik closed her eyes, stopped finning and the momentum sucked her down like a tractor beam. She surrendered to the free-fall, knowing it\u2019s best not to think or move at all. Thoughts require oxygen. Stress torches it. As she sank deeper the increased pressure made her feel as though she was being hugged by the ocean.</p>\n<p>\u201cI definitely felt like I belonged there in that moment,\u201d Artnik said. \u201cIt felt so right.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yet by the time the alarm on her dive watch chimed at 109 meters, five meters above her target depth, she\u2019d been underwater for almost two minutes. She opened her eyes, and when she reached the end of the line at 114 meters, grabbed one of the fluttering tags at the end it, turned and started her ascent toward the surface. To reach light and air again, she\u2019d have to swim against the weight of the water, which feels like swimming against a current.</p>\n<p>Her next breath was still almost two minutes away.</p>\n<p>Artnik didn\u2019t discover free diving until she was 30 years old. At the time, she was managing a skate shop in Slovenia, and lacked purpose. \u201cI was drinking quite a lot and sort of sabotaging myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt that I had something more to give.\u201d</p>\n<p>In December 2011, on a lark she jumped into a pool workout where a group of seven beginners and intermediate free divers performed underwater laps. She held her breath and joined them. She was hooked immediately. She took her first free diving course in the open water the following spring and reached 28 meters (92 feet) in the Mediterranean Sea.</p>\n<p>After her father died in 2013 and the skate shop went out of business in 2015, Artnik sold her family house and traveled to Egypt, training in deep water full time. Back then her personal best was 49 meters (161 feet).</p>\n<p>That\u2019s advanced, not elite.</p>\n<p>When Molchanova disappeared, she was the only woman to have surpassed 100 meters, setting the world record at 101 meters (331 feet). Her death left a void at the top of the sport, especially among women. But in May 2018, Alessia Zecchini of Italy pushed the mark to 105 meters (344 feet). Later that year, Artnik shocked much of the free diving world by matching it. Days later, Zecchini extended the record to 107 meters (351 feet).</p>\n<p>In August 2019, Artnik broke Zecchini\u2019s world record for the first time at the CMAS World Championships in Roat\u00e1n, Honduras, with a dive to 111 meters (364 feet). By the end of that event Artnik and Zecchini held the record together at 113 meters (371 feet).</p>\n<p>The two have become close as they have electrified women\u2019s free diving by hitting depths even the great Molchanova never approached. They were expected this year to continue to push the limits of the sport and one another. But the pandemic forced the cancellation of competitions from Europe to Asia to the Caribbean. Nationwide lockdowns made training difficult.</p>\n<p>In late September, when a buzz rippled through the European free diving community that Egypt was open for business, Artnik and dozens of other European athletes flew in to train in the Red Sea. Artnik spent weeks diving every other day and getting progressively deeper. By late October, she felt she could get the record.</p>\n<p>Andrea Zuccari, the owner of a free dive shop in Sharm el Sheikh that caters to advanced divers, set up the competition with just two weeks\u2019 notice as a vehicle for Artnik\u2019s record attempt. A team of sanctioned judges flew in to certify the dives. The rest was up to Artnik.</p>\n<p>What makes Artnik such an impressive athlete is her ability to tap into power while moving with effortless fluidity. Tito Zappal\u00e1 was Artnik\u2019s deep safety diver for her record attempt. He had been one of her safety divers throughout her time in Sharm, and on Nov. 7, rode an underwater scooter to 60 meters to meet her and monitor her ascent. He marveled as he watched her glide toward the surface, her eyes closed. She reminded him of something the renowned Italian free diving pioneer Enzo Maiorca used to say.</p>\n<p>\u201cTry and be like milk in the water. Dissolve yourself in water,\u201d Zappal\u00e1 said. \u201cShe\u2019s like this. She has the feeling. She has the big connection with the sea.\u201d</p>\n<p>The ascent is the most perilous part of any deep dive because when divers\u2019 oxygen levels get too low, which can happen on dives that extend beyond three minutes, they are at risk of blacking out. Safety divers are trained to pick up on signs of hypoxia and, if they feel a diver is in danger, grab and ferry them to the surface.</p>\n<p>But when a second safety diver joined them at 30 meters, Artnik continued to swim with purpose and control. A third safety diver met them at 10 meters, and Artnik still did not crack. She finned just three more times and calmly floated to the surface after a dive of three minutes and 41 seconds.</p>\n<p>She gripped the line and took sharp inhalations to promote re-oxygenation. Then performed the necessary surface protocols for the judge. When a diver pushes their limits, these seemingly simple tasks can become impossible because of a loss of motor control or consciousness. Artnik removed her nose clip, showed the judge her tag and flashed the OK sign, like she\u2019d just jogged around the block. She said the magic words softly but clearly, \u201cI\u2019m OK.\u201d</p>\n<p>When the judge flashed his white card signaling a record, the safeties and the small band of athletes and spectators erupted in cheers and pounded the water into a froth. Her exit was so clean that when Zecchini watched the video, even she was in awe.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was really happy for her,\u201d she said. \u201cShe did an amazing dive and an amazing exit.\u201d</p>\n<p>In fact, Artnik\u2019s commanding performance suggests \u2014 even as a world-record holder who has helped push women\u2019s free diving to a level few considered possible five years ago \u2014 she has even more to give.</p>\n<p>That she could go deeper still.</p>"

                "body": "<p>KHOMUTYNSI, Ukraine \u2014 Valery Kravchuk, a seasoned mushroom hunter, pushed aside some dead leaves to reveal his prize: a beautiful blusher, so called because it turns pink when pinched.</p>\n<p>\u201cMushrooms are like magnets for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel them.\u201d</p>\n<p>This fall, Ukrainians have been driving their cars down country roads, getting out and walking deep into the forest for the world\u2019s most socially distanced pastime: mushroom hunting.</p>\n<p>By serendipity, the country had a bumper crop of mushrooms in a year when gathering them remains one of the few activities for those wanting to get out of the house while avoiding other people.</p>\n<p>Ukrainian biologists chalked up the bounty this fall to a dry summer followed by an unusually warm fall and late first frost, coming only at the end of November.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll the mushrooms which were supposed to grow starting in July had to fit into a month and a half this autumn,\u201d said Zinaida Kosynska, a mycologist and author of Ukrainian mushroom guidebooks.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s been amazing,\u201d said Emilia Koleda, a professional mushroom hunter who sells her finds on the shoulder of a highway outside Kyiv, the capital.</p>\n<p>She stood beside seven buckets of boletus mushrooms, a late season delicacy that she said she scooped up during just a single forest excursion. In past years, three buckets made for a good day.</p>\n<p>The mushroom bonanza has been a lucky break in a poor country, where mushrooms are a staple for some families, while others supplement their income by picking for the market.</p>\n<p>Ms. Koleda said there were no other possibilities to earn money because of lockdowns. With her income, she bought firewood for winter heating and everything her grandchildren needed for school.</p>\n<p>\u201cMushrooms saved so many people this year,\u201d she said. \u201cNature helped us through the quarantine.\u201d</p>\n<p>In Ukraine, a line of cars parked on the roadside in the middle of nowhere is a telltale sign that hunters are about, walking quietly among the trees, carrying small mushroom harvesting knives.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is my way to be in nature,\u201d said Andriy Hrybovskyi, whose last name translates as \u201cmushroom,\u201d a sign of the activity\u2019s deep roots in Ukraine. He knows a few spots in a forest he can visit after work, to breathe fresh air and find dinner.</p>\n<p>Knowledge of the sites in the forest where mushrooms grow is the currency of mushroom hunters, both professional and amateur, and that knowledge is a closely guarded secret.</p>\n<p>When asked for advice on locations, the etiquette for a polite Ukrainian mushroom hunter is to describe some phony spots, so as not to appear rude, while in fact never revealing where the mushrooms really are. Ukrainians who have taken to tagging spots on Google maps are seen as spoilers of this tradition.</p>\n<p>Many Ukrainian families appoint a designated taster, usually someone deeply versed in the various species who knows which to avoid. The taster will sample the harvest a day before everybody else, just in case. It is a grim tradition, but necessary.</p>\n<p>Viktoria Ganzha, from Poltava in eastern Ukraine, who tastes for her family, has been busy this year. She described the role as that of a sapper, the first to enter a minefield. \u201cI am the de-miner,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>The Ukrainian government has reported an increase in poisonings this year, the sad downside of the mushroom bounty. By mid-November, 289 people had been poisoned and 11 had died, the government said.</p>\n<p>The authorities closely monitor another danger in Ukraine, radioactive mushrooms picked in the region surrounding Chernobyl. Harvesting in the area is illegal, but the mushrooms popping up in the Chernobyl zone this fall have fascinated Ukrainians over anecdotal accounts that they are unnaturally large, fitting the stereotype of radiation\u2019s effects on top of an already good mushroom year.</p>\n<p>The police arrested one group of men smuggling 120 pounds of mushrooms from the Chernobyl zone.</p>\n<p>Professional pickers this year are also finding an abundance of the common toadstool.</p>\n<p>Viktor Klimov, a professional picker in the pine forests in northern Ukraine, specializes in the toadstool. The cartoonish, red-and-white polka-dot mushrooms are poisonous but seen to have medicinal qualities in tiny doses, including bolstering the immune system. Dried toadstools are in demand.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have never seen so many toadstools in my entire life,\u201d Mr. Klimov said of this year\u2019s mushroom season.</p>\n<p>The pine forests where Mr. Klimov works are overgrown with moss, making hunters\u2019 steps silent. Out in this forest, every spoken word feels like a crime. Hunters speak only in a whisper.</p>\n<p>Mushrooms like warm and rainy weather, but not too much of either. They need balance \u2014 and this is exactly the feeling that those who pick them are looking for, too, particularly in this unstable year.</p>\n<p>Mr. Kravchuk, who was hunting this month for blushers, drives slowly on the muddy, barely passable road leading to his spot \u2014 a grove of 100-year-old oaks between farm fields \u2014 believing the mushrooms like a calm atmosphere.</p>\n<p>But while he loves to pick them, Mr. Kravchuk does not enjoy eating them.</p>\n<p>When he returned home, he nibbled a few as a precaution, and then set them aside for his family to pickle or fry with potatoes and onions.</p>"

                "headline": "When Can We Stop Thinking About Trump Every Minute?",
                "subheadline": "The future looks quite different with the president in the rearview mirror.",
                "byline": "By Gail Collins and Bret Stephens",
                "body": "<p>Bret Stephens: Gail, we both need to spend December recovering from the dramas and traumas of 2020, so this will be our last conversation until 2021. Looking back on the year so far, do you feel more optimistic, or less, than you did when it began?</p>\n<p>Gail Collins: Well gee, Bret. Any year in which we get rid of Donald Trump certainly can\u2019t be all bad. It\u2019s hard to get past the coronavirus pall, but I\u2019m gonna pin my hopes on a vaccine program that brings things under control by the time warm weather returns. And the new administration is in full swing.</p>\n<p>How about you?</p>\n<p>Bret: In January I predicted that Trump would win re-election. I\u2019ve never been so glad to be proved wrong. I also feel pretty good about the team Joe Biden is putting together. Janet Yellen isn\u2019t going to blow up the economy. Antony Blinken isn\u2019t going to blow up the free world. Alejandro Mayorkas isn\u2019t going to put kids in cages. All this promises to make 2021 better than 2020 purely by default.</p>\n<p>Gail: Default works for me.</p>\n<p>Bret: On the other hand, there\u2019s a lot that worries me, too. The fact that so many rank-and-file Republicans refuse to accept that Trump lost fair-and-square is a very bad sign about the sanity \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 of the party. The possibility that Trump is going to skip the inauguration so that he can announce his next run for president is another bad sign for and about the party\u2019s future. Together, they augur for the QAnonization of the G.O.P., which is just awful news for a democracy with a two-party system.</p>\n<p>Gail: You know, I was just talking with a friend about the olden days when Republicans were all about balancing the budget and the popular banner of anti-Communism. (Back then, anybody who wanted to raise taxes could get a \u201ccommie\u201d categorization just for proposing the idea.) The Democrats were divided between the old New Deal standard-bearers and younger folks who mostly rallied around the civil rights and antiwar movements.</p>\n<p>But the big heroes in Washington were still senators who could make bipartisan deals and keep things moving.</p>\n<p>Then the social right wing \u2014 particularly the anti-abortion forces \u2014 came up to the front. And the big money people realized they lost nothing financial by making an alliance. Everything is about taking a stand and nothing is about getting stuff done.</p>\n<p>Bret: Maybe my biggest worry, though, is that we\u2019re living in a country where the Dow just hit 30,000 at the same time that people are waiting in line for hours at food banks. That\u2019s a recipe for potentially catastrophic social friction.</p>\n<p>Gail: Couldn\u2019t agree more. How about a great new White House agenda focused on raising taxes on the rich and redistributing the money to the poor? I believe I remember hearing someone talk about that \u2014 Joe Somebody?</p>\n<p>Bret: We agree on the problem but maybe not the solution. The rich will always figure out how to avoid taxes, if not evade them, whether it means setting up complex trusts to protect their wealth or moving to some offshore tax haven. Just look at the Trump family. The people who really get walloped by high taxes are upper-middle class types who don\u2019t have exit options but aren\u2019t exactly the malefactors of great wealth.</p>\n<p>Gail: Yeah, although the upper-middle class still needs to accept that they get a lot of stuff from government and they need to help pay the bill. But the people with genius tax lawyers are the biggest problem, and if you want to join hands and take on Charles Koch, I am with you.</p>\n<p>Bret: But we need to at least think harder about why we tax capital gains at a much lower rate than we tax income. Or why we have an interest-rate regime that punishes savers. Or why some ridiculously burdensome licensing requirements at the state level prevent would-be entrepreneurs from starting small businesses like cosmetology salons.</p>\n<p>Gail: Bret, we are going to go into the new year with so many shared goals, and fights about means to the end. Love it.</p>\n<p>Bret: We also need to think about why we are burdening college students with mountainous debt in exchange for increasingly useless college degrees. B.A. now stands for Bankruptcy by Arts. The best thing that could happen educationally is an investment in community colleges that enhances their value, rigor and prestige.</p>\n<p>Gail: I agree, let the Biden administration focus on how to make community colleges work, occasionally reminding Republicans that should have been one of their goals if the Trump years had actually been about upward mobility for the lower-middle class.</p>\n<p>Bret: One of the worst aspects of Trump\u2019s presidency is the way he simply consumed all of our mental bandwidth, so that it became all but impossible to think of anyone or anything else. Experiencing his presidency was like a bad reaction to dog dander. Or a painfully long bout of hiccups. Or trying to swat away a determined mosquito as it buzzes your ear as you are drifting off to sleep. Or a 6 a.m. car alarm that won\u2019t stop. Or a case of poison ivy in some delicate part of the anatomy.</p>\n<p>Gail: OK, now I am reliving everything and feeling very uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>Bret: And it has gone on for five long years, ever since he came down that blasted escalator. I sometimes fear the Trump administration has reduced us, emotionally and intellectually, to a single thought, played like a Gregorian chant on an endless loop: Just. Make. It. Stop.</p>\n<p>Now, all of a sudden, we\u2019re being reminded that we have real problems, like rising inequality, collapsing social mobility and the mounting financial burden one generation is placing on the next.</p>\n<p>Gail: The whole higher ed situation needs rethinking. Just want to make sure it doesn\u2019t come down to rewarding schools with the least academic rigor and the most cut-rate diplomas.</p>\n<p>Bret: I can\u2019t tell if you are referring to DeVry University or Wesleyan and Yale.</p>\n<p>Gail: Hehehe. Look, this is just one of the multitudinous things we\u2019ve avoided thinking about for the last four years because there were other more pressing issues. You can\u2019t have a heartfelt discussion about animal husbandry when there\u2019s a dinosaur at the door.</p>\n<p>Bret: Ha!</p>\n<p>Gail: Biden\u2019s higher education plan would make community college free for up to two years. For those who want to go further he\u2019d make public colleges tuition free for most students and liberate many of the poor kids who were lured into signing up for an ungodly amount of debt.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s your verdict?</p>\n<p>Bret: I have no problem making college more affordable, but I\u2019m generally against making things free on the view that people rarely value, or stick with, what they don\u2019t pay for.</p>\n<p>Gail: Well, I value sunny skies and chirping birds.</p>\n<p>Bret: Touch\u00e9.</p>\n<p>Gail: The part of funding for higher education that\u2019s worried me most has been the for-profit schools, which the Trump administration allowed to really run amok, encouraging vulnerable kids \u2014 and adults \u2014 to enroll in very expensive programs that leave them drowning in debt.</p>\n<p>Bret: I know very little about for-profit schooling, Gail, and I\u2019ll gladly defer to your judgment. But people are also swimming in debts from attending traditional not-for-profit schools, where tuition increases outpaced inflation and the quality of education can leave a lot to be desired.</p>\n<p>I guess what I\u2019m really thinking about is breaking the current educational mold. For starters, we\u2019d all be better off if college took three years, as it does in England, not four.</p>\n<p>Gail: Just so we can end 2020 on a positive note, I\u2019m prepared to agree to slice off senior year.</p>\n<p>Bret: Or freshman year! I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s ever a good idea for students to go directly from high school to college, and a gap year that entails some form of service would do everyone a lot of good.</p>\n<p>Giant companies like Boeing or Microsoft might be encouraged to start tuition-free apprenticeship schools, loosely on the model of West Point, so they can address their perennial skills shortage while offering successful graduates guaranteed five-year jobs in technical fields.</p>\n<p>Gail: In a perfect world I\u2019d be with you on national service. But the idea of requiring it hasn\u2019t always been popular among the young people it would affect.</p>\n<p>Bret: Anyway, the point here is just to think fresh. After four years of Trump, discussing these things feels a bit like seeing the sun and hearing those chirping birds you were just talking about for the first time in years.</p>\n<p>Gail: Bret, I\u2019m off on vacation now, but when I get back in January we\u2019ll still have time to bid the Trump presidency a few more not-so-fond farewells.</p>\n<p>Happy new year in advance. Already looking forward to battling through the age of Biden with you.</p>\n<p>Bret: Deal. See you in \u201921.</p>\n<p>The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

                "subheadline": "His father and mother were both Nobel winners. His most famous book was about how badly they had treated him.",
                "byline": "By Richard Sandomir",
                "body": "<p>Jan Myrdal, a radical Swedish writer who spurned the liberal politics of his famous Nobel-winning parents and embraced Communism, Marxism and Maoism, died on Oct. 30 in Varberg, Sweden. He was 93.</p>\n<p>His death was announced by Cecilia Cervin, a former chairman of the Jan Myrdal Society, a group dedicated to preserving his extensive book collection.</p>\n<p>Mr. Myrdal traveled and wrote widely, specializing in Asia. He depicted life in a small Chinese village during the Chinese Revolution, and his writings extolled the virtues of authoritarians. He abhorred the damaging effects of Western imperialism on developing countries.</p>\n<p>But perhaps nothing in his career as a polemicist garnered him as much attention as the books he wrote expressing his distaste for his parents, Gunnar and Alva Myrdal. The elder Mr. Myrdal was an economist and sociologist who shared the 1974 Nobel in economic science with Friedrich A. von Hayek and wrote \u201cAn American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy\u201d (1944), a pioneering study of race.</p>\n<p>A cabinet minister and Sweden\u2019s ambassador to India, Mrs. Myrdal split the 1982 Nobel Peace Prize for her work promoting nuclear disarmament.</p>\n<p>But to Jan, his parents were cold, cruel and contemptuous. They called him a \u201cproblem child\u201d and left him with relatives (whom he preferred) for extended periods when they traveled.</p>\n<p>In several autobiographical works he called novels, beginning with \u201cChildhood\u201d (1982), Mr. Myrdal wrote that his father had mocked him for being overweight, asking him, \u201cAre you going to give birth soon?\u201d He said his mother had treated him like a research subject, recording what he said in a notebook.</p>\n<p>Once, he recalled, Gunnar drove his car into a ditch, causing Jan to fall out of the car and hit his head. Bleeding and hoping for sympathy, he heard his father tell him, \u201cDon\u2019t act silly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSince then, I\u2019ve had a scar on my forehead: a triangle,\u201d Mr. Myrdal told The Tampa Bay Times in 1992. \u201cAs if I had been branded.\u201d</p>\n<p>His feelings of not belonging led him, when he was about 10, to ask his father, \u201cAm I your illegitimate son?\u201d The question angered the elder Myrdal, who did not answer, slamming the door behind him.</p>\n<p>The accusations against the prominent Myrdals stirred a scandal in Sweden \u2014 not long before Mrs. Myrdal was awarded her Nobel \u2014 and turned \u201cChildhood\u201d into a best seller.</p>\n<p>When excerpts from the book ran in newspapers, they had headlines like \u201cI Detest My Mother and My Father Because They Never Gave Me Love.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jan Myrdal was born on July 19, 1927, in Stockholm and moved with his parents and younger sisters, Sissela and Kaj, to New York City in 1938; his father had been hired by the Carnegie Corporation to study racism in the United States.</p>\n<p>Jan enjoyed living in Manhattan, where he attended private school and read with fascination books about the French Revolution and the works of the Swedish writer August Strindberg.</p>\n<p>But he was angry when his parents made plans to return to Sweden in 1942. The pending move led to a fight with his father, who, he said, grabbed him by the neck, shook him hard and pinned him to the floor.</p>\n<p>At 15, calling himself a Communist, Jan left his family, dropped out of school and began a peripatetic decades-long career as a writer, provocateur and public intellectual.</p>\n<p>\u201cI chose to write,\u201d he told United Press International in 1987. \u201cIt meant I had to break with school and that kind of education. That I knew from Strindberg and others. One had to make oneself impossible from the start, tear down bridges.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Myrdal began writing books in the mid-1950s, but none attracted much attention until he wrote \u201cReport From a Chinese Village\u201d (1965), which was based on a month that he spent in 1962 interviewing the people of Liu Ling, a tiny rural collection of man-made caves.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn many ways, this is the book that everybody interested in China has been waiting for, a book describing what it feels like to be a peasant living through the Chinese Revolution,\u201d Martin Bernal, an expert on Chinese political history, wrote in The New York Review of Books. He praised the book for the candid stories told by the villagers.</p>\n<p>Some of Mr. Myrdal\u2019s other foreign travel work and political commentary raised questions about his allegiances, or was seen as overly sympathetic to authoritarian rulers.</p>\n<p>His \u201cReport From a Chinese Village\u201d and one of its sequels, \u201cReturn to a Chinese Village\u201d (1984), were viewed as uncritical of the brutality of the Cultural Revolution.</p>\n<p>In 1970, after visiting Albania, then still ruled by the dictator Enver Hoxha, Mr. Myrdal published \u201cAlbania Defiant.\u201d Writing in The New York Times Book Review, the journalist and author Anatole Shub wrote that the book conveyed \u201cthe Gospel according to Hoxha in basically uncritical, dogmatic Marxist terms\u201d and showed \u201cunlimited admiration\u201d for the Albanian people and for Hoxha\u2019s brand of socialism.</p>\n<p>Then, in October 1979, Mr. Myrdal visited Cambodia shortly after the dictator Pol Pot had largely been driven from power by Vietnam but still controlled parts of the country after conducting a reign of terror that led to the deaths of nearly a quarter of Cambodia\u2019s seven million people. Mr. Myrdal had met him a year earlier, and Pol Pot had signed Mr. Myrdal\u2019s visa.</p>\n<p>After his trip, where he had a government official for a babysitter, Mr. Myrdal told The Times that he had seen no \u201chorror stories.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Myrdal went on to punctuate a visit to Iran in 1990 by voicing his support for Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini\u2019s fatwa that Muslims should kill the writer Salman Rushdie for what Khomeini called blasphemy in the Rushdie novel \u201cThe Satanic Verses.\u201d Mr. Myrdal told a Swedish newspaper that the cleric\u2019s order had allowed oppressed Muslim masses in Europe to be part of a struggle \u201cfor their human dignity.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Myrdal\u2019s survivors include his sisters, Sissela Bok, an ethicist and philosopher, and Kaj Folster, a writer. Three of his four marriages ended in divorce. His third wife, Gun Kessle, whose photographs illustrated many of her husband\u2019s books, died in 2007.</p>\n<p>In 1967, well after Mr. Myrdal had become estranged from his parents, the police in Stockholm beat him with batons and arrested him during an anti-Vietnam War protest.</p>\n<p>Still, even in a protest against the United States in the streets of his hometown, he could not avoid the scrutiny of his parents. His mother, then a cabinet minister, had joined the government's decision to deny the protesters a permit, and his father publicly criticized his son for demonstrating.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was insane,\u201d Jan Myrdal said of his father\u2019s rebuke. \u201cAnd six months earlier, Alva had said we should stop seeing each other to avoid compromising her position.\u201d</p>"

A Chinese takeout restaurant opened on Nostrand Avenue, and it became our favorite neighborhood hangout.</p>\n<p>The owner was sympathetic to our poverty, and we negotiated with him for a dish that never appeared on the menu.</p>\n<p>For a nickel, he would serve us a medium-size container of white rice with a ladle full of egg foo young gravy. For another dime, we could get a can of Patio orange soda from the machine there. We enjoyed this special meal four or five times a week.</p>\n<p>Time passed, and we were headed off to college. We encouraged our kindly friend to raise his price to a dime to future customers.</p>\n<p>He smiled and said it would stay a nickel for hungry kids like us.</p>\n<p>\u2014 Joe Trachtenberg</p>\n<h2>The Nursery</h2>\n<p>Dear Diary:</p>\n<p>I was working as an occupational therapist at a preschool on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 19th Street. The therapy room had windows that looked out onto the avenue, but the lunchroom\u2019s view was out the back, onto a courtyard of sorts.</p>\n<p>We were told that the building we could see from there had once been a department store and it had windows that measured probably eight feet high. They were perfect for viewing the comings and goings of the residents of the building\u2019s renovated co-op apartments, \u00e0 la \u201cRear Window.\u201d</p>\n<p>Through the bare windows of one apartment, we could see a young couple as they moved in and began to make the place their own. After a few months, one of the rooms began to fill with baby stuff. It was being turned into a nursery.</p>\n<p>As the months went on, it became a topic of lunchroom conversation: Would the baby be a boy or a girl? When would the child arrive? There was talk of getting a betting pool going on the date of birth, but we tried to not to be caught gawking too obviously.</p>\n<p>The big day finally arrived, a Friday, and the proud parents brought the baby home. How could we get the answer to our remaining question? </p>\n<p>One of the teachers put up a sign facing the apartment. </p>\n<p>\u201cCongratulations!\u201d it said. \u201cBoy or girl?\u201d</p>\n<p>The father responded quickly, raising his own sign in our direction: \u201cIt\u2019s a boy!!\u201d</p>\n<p>We all waved at one another and flashed thumbs-up signs.</p>\n<p>By Monday, all the apartment\u2019s windows had curtains and shades.</p>\n<p>\u2014 Robert Flynn</p>\n<h2>At the Morgan</h2>\n<p>Dear Diary:</p>\n<p>Visiting the Morgan Library and Museum, I ventured into the West Room of J. Pierpont Morgan\u2019s library, a cavernous and elegant space.</p>\n<p>Surveying the giant fireplace, the endless bookshelves and the substantial desk, I was taken with a desire to see what it would be like to command that empire.</p>\n<p>The desk chair, of course, was roped off, but I walked behind the desk and got a sense of the solitude and power that came with being in that spot.</p>\n<p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d a hearty voice said as I began to leave. I turned and saw that it was a young female security guard. She was smiling at me.</p>\n<p>Sensing my surprise, she told me that while men frequently ventured behind the desk, I was the first woman she had seen do it.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d I replied. \u201cI\u2019m sure that you have done it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her smile widened into a mischievous grin.</p>\n<p>\u2014 Christine McCormick </p>\n<h2>Happy Birthday</h2>\n<p>Dear Diary:</p>\n<p>I had celebrated my 78th birthday with a few relatives at my sister\u2019s home in Connecticut. We ate, watched a video, opened presents and talked. It was a lovely day that came to its conclusion with me taking a cab to my apartment from the 125th Street train station.</p>\n<p>As we approached my building, I found that I wanted to hold onto the day a little while longer. I told the driver that it was my birthday.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>I had paid him and was preparing to get out of the cab when I noticed that he was rather frantically looking for something. I was a little curious about what he was doing, but I was mostly focused on the delicate task of climbing out of the car.</p>\n<p>\u201cHappy Birthday!\u201d he said, reaching his hand awkwardly toward the back seat.

                "body": "<p>Dave Prowse, the British actor who gave the imposing physical presence \u2014 but not the voice \u2014 to Darth Vader in the original \u201cStar Wars\u201d trilogy, died on Saturday in a hospital in London. He was 85.</p>\n<p>Mr. Prowse\u2019s death was confirmed by Thomas Bowington, his agent. Mr. Prowse\u2019s family did not release a cause of death, but he retired in 2016 because of ill health, Mr. Bowington said.</p>\n<p>Standing 6-foot-6 and with a physique honed by years of weight lifting (he was once the British heavyweight champion), Mr. Prowse had the perfect presence for the role of Darth Vader, whom he played in 1977\u2019s \u201cStar Wars,\u201d in \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back\u201d in 1980 and in \u201cReturn of the Jedi\u201d in 1983.</p>\n<p>He was scouted for the role by George Lucas, the franchise\u2019s creator, who had seen Mr. Prowse play a bodyguard in Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u201cA Clockwork Orange.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Lucas actually offered Mr. Prowse a choice of roles for the original \u201cStar Wars\u201d: Chewbacca, the hairy, gentle giant and a hero in the franchise; or Darth Vader, the arch-villain. Mr. Prowse told the BBC in a 2013 interview that the choice had been simple. \u201cI said, \u2018Well, don\u2019t say any more, George, I\u2019ll have the villain\u2019s part,\u2019\u201d Mr. Prowse recalled. \u201cYou always remember the bad guy.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was another reason he turned down Chewbacca, he added: \u201cI thought, \u2018Oh, God no, three months in a gorilla skin, no thank you very much.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Prowse\u2019s voice had the distinctive agricultural tones of someone born in Bristol, in southwest England, and many believe that is why he did not get to voice Darth Vader. His lines were instead overdubbed by James Earl Jones after filming had finished.</p>\n<p>In the BBC interview, Mr. Prowse said that it was not actually his accent that had led to the change. Wearing Darth Vader\u2019s mask had caused his lines to come out muffled during filming, he said, and Mr. Lucas did not have time to fly him out to America to overdub the lines afterward.</p>\n<p>Mr. Prowse only learned that his voice was missing from the film at its premiere. \u201cI\u2019m watching the film and all of a sudden this strange voice comes over,\u201d he told the BBC in the 2013 interview. \u201cI thought, \u2018Oh, goodness me, that\u2019s not me.\u2019\u201d But he said that Mr. Jones had been \u201ca great choice\u201d for the part and the pair became friends.</p>\n<p>But some said the change was inevitable because of his accent. \u201cThey always knew they were not going to use that voice,\u201d Carrie Fisher, who played Princess Leia in the films, said in a 2016 BBC interview. \u201cWe called him Darth Farmer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Prowse\u2019s face and voice could have finally made an appearance in the franchise in \u201cThe Return of the Jedi\u201d when Luke Skywalker (played by Mark Hamill) removes Darth Vader\u2019s mask so that the pair can look at each other. But Mr. Lucas instead decided to use the actor Sebastian Shaw to play the character in that moment.</p>\n<p>In some fight scenes, Darth Vader was also played by Bob Anderson, a fencer and stunt double.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the changes, Mr. Prowse was always a favorite of \u201cStar Wars\u201d fans and spent much of his life afterward attending conventions and dealing with fan mail \u2014 some of it of a salacious nature from women who found his suit sexy, he told Jackie Collins in a 1980 interview.</p>\n<p>David Charles Prowse was born in Bristol, England, on July 1, 1935. His first passion was not acting but bodybuilding and he won the British heavyweight championship in weight lifting in the 1960s. Once he moved into acting, his first roles were mainly as monsters in horror movies.</p>\n<p>In Britain, he became more widely known when he got the part of the Green Cross Code Man, a superhero who promoted road safety. He appeared as the character in a government television campaign and also toured schools to encourage children to stop, look and listen before crossing the street.</p>\n<p>The British government almost fired him from that role after \u201cStar Wars\u201d came out, Mr. Prowse told Ms. Collins in the 1980 interview, because they felt Darth Vader\u2019s image could clash with a road safety campaign. </p>\n<p>That campaign ran until 1990, and Mr. Prowse wrote in a 2014 piece for The Guardian that it was \u201cthe best job I\u2019ve ever had, including my Star Wars role, and by far my proudest achievement.\u201d But even in Britain, Mr. Prowse will most likely be remembered more for being the man behind the suit in \u201cStar Wars\u201d than anything else.</p>\n<p>He is survived by his wife, Norma Scammell, and three children, Mr. Bowington said.</p>"

                "subheadline": "The judiciary is crucial to the city\u2019s status as a global hub for trade and finance. But the Chinese Communist Party has been gaining more authority over it.",
                "byline": "By Austin Ramzy",
                "body": "<p>HONG KONG \u2014 They were arrested on one of the most violent days in Hong Kong last year, when protesters threw firebombs at the main government offices and set a barrier aflame outside Police Headquarters. But last month, a judge quickly dismantled the prosecutors\u2019 case against them.</p>\n<p>In his ruling, District Judge Sham Siu-man said that police officers had given unreliable testimony, and that they appeared to have gone against their training by using batons to subdue one protester. He found all eight defendants not guilty, saying one had merely been asking the police to do their job when she used a loudspeaker to urge restraint.</p>\n<p>The next day, a Chinese government-owned newspaper in Hong Kong splashed a photo of the judge, wearing his court wig and robes, on its front page beside images of protesters and burning barriers. \u201cStrange opinion issued by the court,\u201d the headline read. The judge, it continued, says the protesters \u201cwere actually the ones wronged.\u201d</p>\n<p>As the Chinese Communist Party extends its grip over Hong Kong, pro-Beijing forces are increasingly targeting the city\u2019s independent judiciary, an institution that forms the backbone of this global center for commerce and capital.</p>\n<p>State newspapers have railed for months against \u201cyellow judges\u201d seen as lenient toward protesters. (The color yellow is a symbol of the protest movement.) Party officials have called for an overhaul of the courts to rein in judges\u2019 autonomy. The city\u2019s leadership has exerted more influence over the selection of judges.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt would be na\u00efve for anyone to think they will leave the judiciary alone. Why would they?\u201d said Dennis Kwok, who represented Hong Kong\u2019s legal sector in the local legislature until he was removed from office this month. \u201cThey want to get their hands on everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>The far-reaching national security law that Beijing passed this summer gives the state even more authority over the Hong Kong judiciary. China\u2019s legislature also bypassed the local courts to force the ouster of four lawmakers in November, exercising new powers that some lawyers and legal scholars worry could be turned against judges.</p>\n<p>The Hong Kong judiciary, with its British-born, 170-year-old tradition of robes, wigs and independence, is at the heart of an existential fight over the territory\u2019s future.</p>\n<p>Hong Kong\u2019s courts firmly divide the city from mainland China, where the opaque legal system is under the control of the Communist Party. The city\u2019s underlying rule of law has helped attract droves of multinational corporations, bringing a flood of money that has made Hong Kong one of the world\u2019s leading cities.</p>\n<p>The judicial system\u2019s integrity is fiercely defended in Hong Kong. The demonstrations that engulfed the city last year began over a proposal that many saw as potentially undermining the local courts, by allowing extraditions to mainland China.</p>\n<p>In addition to imposing the national security law, Communist Party officials and state newspapers in the city are pushing for still more control. In a continuing series, Ta Kung Pao, a newspaper owned by the Chinese government\u2019s liaison office in Hong Kong, has demanded that judges be patriotic. It has called for establishing a council to set the length of sentences, an external panel to handle complaints about judges and greater scrutiny over the judicial selection process.</p>\n<p>\u201cBeijing understands that this is an area that people will be very sensitive to and the international community will be watching over,\u201d said Eric Cheung, a legal scholar at the University of Hong Kong. \u201cBeijing may not want to be seen as interfering with judicial independence, but I think it is very clear some Beijing officials are not happy with some decisions made by our judges.\u201d</p>\n<p>Even before the protests and the security law, Beijing had significant judicial oversight. When China reclaimed Hong Kong from Britain in 1997, the ultimate authority for interpretation of its laws moved to Beijing.</p>\n<p>The Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress, China\u2019s rubber-stamp legislature, has the power to interpret the Basic Law, Hong Kong\u2019s local constitution. Several of its rulings have gone against the city\u2019s pro-democracy camp. The committee\u2019s interpretation of oath-taking in 2016 paved the way for the removal of six pro-democracy lawmakers who had protested during their swearing-in ceremonies.</p>\n<p>The security law has further constricted the city\u2019s courts. It allows for some cases, such as those involving foreign forces or imminent threats, to be tried on the mainland. Under the law, Carrie Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, will designate judges for trials on national security charges.</p>\n<p>Hong Kong\u2019s Department of Justice recently pressed beyond the scope of the law, asking that a judge authorized to hear national security matters handle the trial of Tam Tak-chi, an activist charged with sedition and unauthorized assembly. Those charges do not fall under the security law.</p>\n<p>Britain is considering whether to bar its judges from serving in Hong Kong. Foreign judges serve temporary roles on the Court of Final Appeal so the city can maintain ties to common-law countries.</p>\n<p>Both the pro-Beijing and pro-democracy camps have found fault with the courts over protest cases \u2014 perhaps signaling that the judiciary remains an impartial institution, with a range of outlooks among judges.</p>\n<p>A High Court judge was criticized by pro-Beijing figures for ruling this month that the riot police had not been carrying sufficient identification and that mechanisms for dealing with complaints of police mistreatment needed to be improved. The Hong Kong Journalists Association had filed the suit over the police\u2019s handling of reporters during protests.</p>\n<p>Some judges have been lambasted by the opposition for giving tough sentences to demonstrators, or for appearing to sympathize with people who attacked protesters. After a district judge compared the protest movement to terrorism in an April ruling, Geoffrey Ma, the chief justice of the Court of Final Appeal, barred him from future cases related to the political upheaval.</p>\n<p>The criticism of judges, from both sides, has grown so frequent this year that Justice Ma issued a lengthy defense of the judiciary\u2019s independence.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is wrong to make serious accusations of bias or breach of fundamental principles merely based on a result of a case not to one\u2019s liking,\u201d he wrote in September. \u201cThe judiciary is not above criticism by any means but any criticism must be solidly based and properly made. In particular, there must not be a politicization of the judiciary and its functions.\u201d</p>\n<p>So far, the protest cases that have been prosecuted do not indicate that the courts lean strongly to one side or another.</p>\n<p>Of 10,148 people arrested in the protests, 2,325 have been prosecuted for crimes such as rioting, unlawful assembly or assault. As of the end of October, 372 had been convicted and 77 acquitted, according to Hong Kong police records.</p>\n<p>Rioting, in particular, has been a tough charge to prove. Among the protest-related rioting cases that had been prosecuted as of the end of October, there were four guilty pleas, one conviction and 12 acquittals, according to an analysis in Stand News, a local online publication.</p>\n<p>As the demonstrations heated up last year, the police used increasingly aggressive tactics, charging into crowds and grabbing stragglers. But in court, the authorities have struggled to explain why defendants were targeted and to provide evidence of their wrongdoing.</p>\n<p>Judge Sham, in his ruling last month, wrote that the police might have been responding out of anger when they arrested Jackie Chen, a social worker charged with rioting. Ms. Chen had held a small loudspeaker during the protest and urged the police to let people leave peacefully.</p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone stood up and reminded them to act according to the law,\u201d Judge Sham wrote. \u201cThis might make some police officers feel unhappy, but if the person is charged with rioting, I can\u2019t see how the person would become a rioter.\u201d</p>\n<p>The government is appealing the acquittals in that case.</p>\n<p>Ms. Chen says she is frustrated by the process and contends that the government\u2019s apparently unending pursuit of such cases undermines the legal system. But she added that her initial victory gave her some solace.</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone still has one ray of hope: that you face a normal judge in court, and hope that you would not be found guilty,\u201d she said. \u201cBut even if you are not found guilty, you could expect that decision to be appealed. Then you hope that the appeal wouldn\u2019t succeed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tiffany May contributed reporting.</p>"

                "byline": "By Barry Meier",
                "body": "<p>It was the comedian Judd Apatow who convinced me to invest a little too much of my time in the two recent documentaries about the sex cult Nxivm.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Vow\u201d on HBO and \u201cSeduced\u201d on Starz have a combined running time of 13 hours. I make cameos in both shows as the reporter for The New York Times who in 2017 broke the story about Nxivm (pronounced Nex-e-um), and had fast forwarded through them to check out how good I looked. (Quite good, it turns out.)</p>\n<p>The Nxivm story was bizarre and sickening. The group, which was based near Albany, N.Y., offered \u201cself-improvement\u201d courses, claiming they would help participants overcome fears and realize their potential. But Nxivm was a misogynistic, mind-control cult whose adherents referred to its leader, Keith Raniere, as \u201cVanguard,\u201d and where women who joined a secret sorority were branded with a symbol containing his initials. Over the past two years, several Nxivm officials have pleaded guilty to federal charges and Raniere, following his conviction for sex trafficking and other crimes, was recently sentenced to 120 years in prison.</p>\n<p>I\u2019d had my fill of Nxivm. But the documentaries have become pandemic TV hits and, given my role in them, plenty of people have offered me their opinions of the shows. They have included friends and acquaintances I wouldn\u2019t have expected to spend evenings absorbed by a sex cult. Then, my interest was further piqued when Apatow tweeted, \u201cI may need to do a 300 hour podcast to explain why The Vow goes so much easier on the NXIVM cult than Seduced.\u201d</p>\n<p>I decided to watch the documentaries more closely to see how their depictions of Nxivm jibed with my impressions. They struck me as starkly different from each other. \u201cThe Vow\u201d resembles a crime show that follows several Nxivm defectors and the actress Catherine Oxenberg, whose daughter India became a member of the cult, in real time as they try to alert law enforcement authorities to its horrors. \u201cSeduced,\u201d in which the Oxenbergs are the central characters, is a study of the coercive techniques used by cults and delves deeply into the abuse that Nxivm visited on its female members.</p>\n<p>I watched \u201cThe Vow\u201d first because I played a part in its story. I learned about Nxivm from the two filmmakers, Jehane Noujaim and Karim Amer, who would go on to direct the show. The couple had previously made \u201cThe Square,\u201d a well-received documentary about the Arab Spring, and we met in 2016 when they approached me about making a documentary based on a book I had written about a former FBI agent, Robert A. Levinson, who disappeared in Iran.</p>\n<p>In mid-2017, they sent me urgent text messages asking if I was willing to speak with some people in grave danger. They put me in touch with Mark Vicente, a top lieutenant to Raniere, who had just left Nxivm after learning about the branding of women. Vicente then connected me with Catherine Oxenberg and several Nxivm defectors including his wife, Bonnie Piesse, Sarah Edmondson, a Canadian actress, and her husband.</p>\n<p>They all provided me with critical information contained in the Times expos\u00e9 of Nxivm and appear in the article. But back when I started reporting the story, I soon discovered that the tip from Noujaim and Amer hadn\u2019t been random. They were already following the experiences of the defectors with an eye toward making a documentary, and were apparently hopeful that I would be a character in it; namely, the intrepid reporter. They said they often had a journalist figure in their films. I told them that wasn\u2019t happening with me.</p>\n<p>There is no question in my mind that Catherine Oxenberg and the defectors featured in \u201cThe Vow\u201d were among the heroes who brought down Nxivm. And \u201cThe Vow\u201d captures their anxieties and fears as they face threats of legal reprisals from the group and rejection by former friends who remain loyal to Raniere.</p>\n<p>But while the documentary\u2019s v\u00e9rit\u00e9 style offers intimacy, several defectors in the show are Hollywood types comfortable around a camera and seem at times to be playing to it. Also, in my first encounters with the film\u2019s characters, they stuck me as messier \u2014 and in turn, more interesting \u2014 than how they appear in \u201cThe Vow.\u201d</p>\n<p>For instance, Vicente and Edmondson insisted during our first talks that Nxivm wasn\u2019t a cult but a self-improvement group that had somehow gone off the rails. And Vicente, a filmmaker who shot much of footage chronicling Raniere\u2019s reign that animates \u201cThe Vow,\u201d told me that he still wanted to promote a movie he had made that glorified Raniere\u2019s activities in Mexico. I told him I thought he was nuts.</p>\n<p>The first season of \u201cThe Vow\u201d also omits a piece of context about Vicente: Before joining Nxivm, he had been a devotee of another cult. One of the show\u2019s directors, Amer, said the issue will figure into one of several additional episodes of \u201cThe Vow\u201d that will run on HBO next year. Those episodes will continue the show\u2019s chronological approach and focus on Raniere\u2019s trial and information disclosed during it, he said.</p>\n<p>I came to \u201cSeduced,\u201d with fresher eyes, though I was aware of some behind-the-scenes friction and competition between the shows. Initially, Catherine Oxenberg only took part in \u201cThe Vow,\u201d and India had no interest in talking about her experiences in Nxivm.</p>\n<p>I never spoke with India while reporting on Nxivm. Back then, she was lost in the cult, and federal prosecutors might have indicted her along with other Raniere followers but for the relentless efforts of her mother. So I was surprised when I saw her positioned as the main character in \u201cSeduced\u201d \u2014 she comes across as sane and chastised, a tribute to the healing powers of cult deprogramming for those who can afford it.</p>\n<p>(Close watchers of the shows will notice that they only see India in \u201cThe Vow\u201d in archival footage. The same is true for the appearances of Vicente and Edmondson in \u201cSeduced.\u201d)</p>\n<p>Overall, I would give \u201cSeduced,\u201d which was created by Cecilia Peck and Inbal B. Lessner, the higher marks for clarity and brevity. The show\u2019s immediate portrayal of Raniere as an embodiment of misogynistic evil matched my impressions, and it quickly demolishes the delusion that Nxivm was successful. (The cult was financially propped up by two of its adherents, Clare and Sara Bronfman, heirs to the Seagram liquor fortune.) The show, however, struck me as a little too heavy on self-described \u201ccult experts\u201d and talking heads (which I guess includes me).</p>\n<p>Critics have lauded both documentaries for highlighting how cults prey on the vulnerable. But cults don\u2019t exist in isolation, and neither show explored an area I had often wondered about: the ranks of enablers outside Nxivm \u2014 lawyers, public officials and others \u2014 who had unwittingly or otherwise shielded the group.</p>\n<p>Soon after watching the shows, my wife and I were walking at dusk along a lovely country road when my cellphone rang and \u201cDanielle Roberts\u201d appeared on the caller ID. At first, the name didn\u2019t ring a bell. Then, I remembered that she was the physician and Nxivm member described in my first article about the cult as having used a cauterizing device to brand women.</p>\n<p>Roberts had dodged my calls when I was working on the story. Now, she was calling me on the eve of Raniere\u2019s sentencing. She and other of the cult leader\u2019s remaining followers had proof, she said, that prosecutors had manufactured evidence against him. Roberts wanted me to immediately write an article for The Times about this supposed miscarriage of justice. I told her that I had retired from the newspaper and passed her along to a former colleague.</p>\n<p>The next day, Raniere was sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison. That\u2019s a long time and, during the duration, I hope to never hear about Nxivm again.</p>\n<p>Barry Meier is a former New York Times reporter and author.

Yellen, the former Federal Reserve chair, as Treasury secretary \u2014 would potentially culminate in several women in top economic roles, including the first Black woman to lead the Council of Economic Advisers and the first Indian-American to lead the Office of Management and Budget. All three jobs require Senate confirmation.</p>\n<p>With the picks, Mr. Biden is showcasing a commitment to diversity in his advisers and sending a clear message that economic policymaking in his administration will be shaped by liberal thinkers with a strong focus on worker empowerment as a tool for economic growth.</p>\n<p>Two of Mr. Biden\u2019s top economic aides during his presidential campaign, Jared Bernstein and Heather Boushey, will also be named to the Council of Economic Advisers, which is a three-member team that advises the president on economic policy. Both Ms. Boushey and Mr. Bernstein come from a liberal, labor-oriented school of economics that views rising inequality as a threat to the economy and emphasizes government efforts to support and empower workers.</p>\n<p>In many ways, his team is unified by a commitment to running the economy hot \u2014 with strong growth and low unemployment \u2014 in order to drive up wages.

He was also a special adviser on climate change to Mr. Obama, a role that could signal Mr. Biden\u2019s commitment to fashioning an infrastructure bill for his legislative agenda that heavily features spending on clean energy initiatives.</p>\n<p>Mr. Biden on Sunday announced an all-female White House communications staff, with Jennifer Psaki, a veteran of the Obama administration, in the most visible role as White House press secretary.</p>\n<p>Kate Bedingfield, 39, who served as a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Biden, will serve as the White House communications director. Karine Jean Pierre, who previously served as the chief public affairs officer for MoveOn.org, will be the principal deputy press secretary. Pili Tobar, a former immigrant advocate with the group America\u2019s Voice, will serve as the deputy White House communications director.</p>\n<p>Symone Sanders, a senior adviser to Mr. Biden on the campaign, will serve as the senior adviser and chief spokeswoman for Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. Ashley Etienne, a former senior adviser to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, will serve as the communications director for Ms. Harris.</p>\n<p>The appointments indicate Mr. Biden\u2019s plan to include racial, gender and ideological diversity in top roles, fulfilling a campaign pledge to ensure that a broad swath of America is represented in policymaking decisions.</p>\n<p>But they could fall short of hopes within the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, which has been frustrated that their views are not being sufficiently represented in early personnel decisions. In particular, the decision to select Ms. Tanden, a divisive and partisan figure in the Democratic Party, could culminate in an intraparty fight, as well as a confirmation battle.</p>\n<p>Republicans, who are expected to retain control of the Senate, are unlikely to easily pass Ms. Tanden, who advised Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and has been one of the most outspoken critics of President Trump.</p>\n<p>She could also face questions from Senate Democrats given her role in the 2016 election: Many of those who worked for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who ran against Mrs. Clinton, remain convinced that Ms. Tanden was part of a group of Democrats working behind the scenes to scuttle his nomination.</p>\n<h2>Latest Updates</h2>\n<p>Josh Holmes, a former chief of staff to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, referred to Ms. Tanden on Twitter on Sunday as a \u201csacrifice to the confirmation gods,\u201d suggesting that her downfall would sate Republican anger toward Mr. Biden\u2019s presidency and allow other nominees to more easily win confirmation.</p>\n<p>Drew Brandewie, a spokesman for Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, said on Twitter on Sunday evening that Ms. Tanden \u201cstands zero chance of being confirmed.\u201d</p>\n<p>But Stacey Abrams, a voting rights activist in Georgia and a rising star in the Democratic Party, praised Ms. Tanden\u2019s nomination, saying on Twitter that she was \u201cvery proud\u201d of her friend.</p>\n<p>The selection of Ms. Tanden, who was involved in the development of the Affordable Care Act as an adviser to the Department of Health and Human Services during the Obama administration, is likely to resurface questions about the funding of the Center for American Progress. The New York Times reported last year that from 2016 through 2018, the center accepted nearly $2.5 million from the United Arab Emirates to fund its National Security and International Policy initiative.</p>\n<p>In addition, hacked emails from Ms. Tanden that were released through WikiLeaks in 2016 could also provide additional fodder for her critics.</p>\n<p>Mr. Biden\u2019s other picks are most likely less contentious. Ms. Rouse, a labor economist, worked on Mr. Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers from 2009 to 2011 and at the White House\u2019s National Economic Council during the Clinton administration in the late 1990s.</p>\n<p>Claudia Goldin, a Harvard economist, a pioneer in research on the role of women in the American economy and one of Ms. Rouse\u2019s thesis advisers in graduate school, called her a leading expert on labor markets and education.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe is a deeply thoughtful person and a superb listener who brings out the best of those around her,\u201d Ms. Goldin said.</p>\n<p>Mr. Bernstein was Mr. Biden\u2019s first chief economist when he was vice president and has written extensively on the power of low unemployment and strong economic growth to bolster workers and wages. Ms. Boushey runs the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a liberal think tank focused on inequality, and was a top policy adviser to Mrs. Clinton in 2016. She has focused much of her research and writing on government initiatives meant to increase women\u2019s participation in the labor force, such as paid leave programs.</p>\n<p>The appointments drew praise from Kevin A. Hassett, Mr. Trump\u2019s first Council of Economic Advisers chairman.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey have put together a very strong team of experienced policymakers and smart economists,\u201d Mr. Hassett said. \u201cAt this difficult time, it is great to know that a strong C.E.A. will be helping to guide policy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Adeyemo is an immigrant from Nigeria and has extensive experience working at the Treasury Department during the Obama administration, when he was a senior adviser and deputy chief of staff. Mr. Adeyemo was also Mr. Obama\u2019s chief negotiator for the macroeconomic policy provisions of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Democrats ultimately opposed, and served as the first chief of staff of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. After a two-year stint as a senior adviser at BlackRock, he joined the Obama Foundation in 2019 as its president.</p>\n<p>Michael D. Shear and Jeanna Smialek contributed reporting.</p>"

                "byline": "By Jeremy Gordon",
                "body": "<p>The lovesick kiss-off \u201cSilly Games\u201d and its indelible high note play a pivotal part in \u201cLovers Rock,\u201d one of five pieces in the director Steve McQueen\u2019s new \u201cSmall Axe\u201d anthology, which examines Black British life across the \u201960s, \u201970s and \u201980s.</p>\n<p>The film takes its name from the musical genre lovers rock, a softer, sentimental spin on reggae created and popularized in mid-70s England by the first generation of British citizens born to Caribbean immigrants and Caribbean-born immigrants who moved to Britain at a young age. \u201cLovers Rock,\u201d which arrived on Amazon Prime Nov. 27, is a fictional story set in 1980 that follows a woman named Martha (Amarah-Jae St. Aubyn) as she attends a \u201cblues party\u201d (short for \u201crhythm and blues\u201d), a nighttime gathering thrown by Black people denied entry into white-dominated clubs. Blues parties usually took place in houses belonging to members of the community, where D.J.s would guide the festivities on professional sound systems.</p>\n<p>As McQueen\u2019s characters come together, they\u2019re backlit by artists like Janet Kay, Dennis Brown and Gregory Isaacs, who set the stage for young love to freely sprout. Kay\u2019s \u201cSilly Games,\u201d which reached No. 2 on the British singles chart, \u201chad to be the heartbeat of the party,\u201d McQueen said, \u201cbecause it has so many meanings \u2014 the yearning, and the vulnerability of the singer. That\u2019s the bravest thing you could possibly do, falling in love, because you\u2019re opening yourself to hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p>Recreating a 1980s house party involved extensive research, partly informed by McQueen and his co-writer Courttia Newland\u2019s memories. McQueen, born in 1969, was occasionally brought to the events as a child, once falling asleep and \u201cwaking up with all these coats on me.\u201d Those memories constituted a lodestone of evidence during the research process. \u201cI remember, for example, the sweat dripping down the walls,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThings like the carpet in a West Indian front room, the clothes, and so forth.\u201d</p>\n<p>On top of all that, \u201cthe music was the scent in the air which changed everything,\u201d he explained.</p>\n<p>Lovers rock represented a major shift. \u201cPre-lovers rock, it was predominantly a male dance floor \u2014 it was cool for a guy to dance on his own or with other guys,\u201d said Mykaell Riley, a senior lecturer and director for the Black Music Research Unit at the University of Westminster, who consulted on the film. By spotlighting female vocalists, who sang about romantic concerns rather than the politics inherent to traditional roots reggae, lovers rock musicians and D.J.s were able to fundamentally alter the trajectory of the night.</p>\n<p>According to Dennis Bovell, the lovers rock pioneer who wrote \u201cSilly Games\u201d and also consulted on McQueen\u2019s project, changing this gender dynamic was something like a mission statement for the nascent genre. \u201cWe wanted to bring the girls to the front, and make them the stars,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cSilly Games\u201d is first heard in the opening minutes of \u201cLovers Rock,\u201d sung by a group of women cooking food for the party. Later on, when the night has reached its romantic crescendo, it\u2019s played in full by the D.J.s, and then sung a cappella by the entire room in an ecstatic sequence lasting 10 minutes that wasn\u2019t scripted to carry on that long, but unfolded naturally during the filming.</p>\n<p>Beyond the historical significance of songs like \u201cSilly Games,\u201d McQueen and his team also endeavored to make the soundtrack period accurate, rather than a well-curated anachronistic pastiche.</p>\n<p>\u201cA guiding principle was to not just get into crate digging territory, because at the end of the day it\u2019s a community party,\u201d said Ed Bailie, a music supervisor who worked on \u201cSmall Axe,\u201d adding that they looked for tracks that would \u201cmake people who are in the garden go into the living room.\u201d A relatively light moment takes place early on in the night, when the D.J. transitions from the disco group Sister Sledge to Carl Douglas\u2019s novelty single \u201cKung Fu Fighting,\u201d prompting Martha and the other partygoers to pantomime martial arts action as they dance.</p>\n<p>Securing legal permission to use some of these songs wasn\u2019t easy. Many of the original labels that hosted the kind of music heard in the film have since shut down or been folded into a winding maze of corporate parents and their subsidiaries, requiring the filmmakers to be flexible about what would make it into the final product.</p>\n<p>For example, getting the rights to Cry Tuff and the Originals\u2019 skeletal dub track \u201cRobin Hood,\u201d which is used to test the sound system before the party begins, required a fact-finding mission. Searching for the owner led Bailie\u2019s team to the estate of Prince Far I, the Jamaican musician who occasionally recorded under the Cry Tuff pseudonym, and who died in 1983. After prolonged communication, including plenty of \u201clate night calls with the clearance team at BBC,\u201d Bailie said, the proper contracts were sent along and signed over smartphones.</p>\n<p>The diversity of music mirrors the film\u2019s arc, with the playlist transitioning from poppy crowd pleasers to dreamy ballads to, near the end, a predominantly male dance floor exuberantly cutting loose to murky dub cuts by the Revolutionaries and August Pablo. That reflected reality, too, as there would come a point in the night when the couples had paired off, leaving the male stragglers to reclaim the dance floor. \u201cIt was warrior-like, because you could be the person you wanted to be,\u201d McQueen said.</p>\n<p>These spaces reflected then-ongoing debates within the Black British community. Bovell said that in the genre\u2019s early days, a lovers rock singer\u2019s background might be intentionally obscured in order to avoid accusations they were less legitimate than native Jamaican singers. \u201cThere\u2019s an identity crisis which is, \u2018Am I more Jamaican? Or am I more British? Am I British-Jamaican?\u2019\u201d Riley said, pointing out that the authenticity of lovers rock, which he called the \u201cfirst Black British genre in response to Jamaican popular music,\u201d was questioned along the same lines. \u201cIt carried an element of pop that was very different from roots reggae. But it held its own, and this is what was genius about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bovell described a defiance that came with the genre\u2019s birth. \u201cWhen we came to look at making reggae in London and to give it a London identity, we were struggling against all the doubters that said, \u2018You can\u2019t beat reggae outside of Jamaica,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYou bet we can. And we\u2019re going to do it here and show it to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>One of the joys of McQueen\u2019s film is how it gestures at these ideas within the conceit of one magical night, where young love takes root amid such greater tensions. For Bovell, who cameos in the film as a lodger in the house where the party takes place, and whose low voice can be heard during the \u201cSilly Games\u201d sequence, the experience of filming was like stepping into a time machine. \u201cIt was so real to be in that room,\u201d he said. \u201cI was thrown back 40 years.\u201d</p>\n<p>McQueen said that even with all the research that went into the episode, the alchemy of the final product is something he couldn\u2019t have planned for. \u201cYou cram everything into a room to get the closest you possibly can,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that one thing you cannot manage happened. I don\u2019t know why.\u201d A moment later, he corrected himself: \u201cYou know why it happened? Because we wanted it to happen.\u201d</p>"

                "byline": "By The Editorial Board",
                "body": "<p>It took a pandemic, but New York City is seeing more clearly than ever that its roadways can do more than move cars and trucks.</p>\n<p>Restaurants transformed parking spaces into outdoor dining rooms festooned with lights and plants.</p>\n<p>Children reclaimed the city\u2019s side streets, playing catch on the asphalt.</p>\n<p>Peaceful protesters flooded the streets with cries for justice in the police killings of Black Americans.</p>\n<p>In a year with so little solace, New York\u2019s streetscape has brought steady relief. It\u2019s just one example of the many opportunities before the city in the months and years ahead to reimagine how its residents can live, work, play and get around town.</p>\n<p>One solid step would be making expansive outdoor dining a permanent fixture of New York life. But there are more urgent tasks \u2014\u00a0such as protecting pedestrians and cyclists from vehicles. After years of progress, pedestrian and cyclist deaths rose to 126 in 2019, from 105 in 2018, and are on track this year to be only slightly lower. Overall traffic fatalities are up to 218 this year, from 191 in 2019, according to city data. City officials said vehicle registrations are up, and the city has seen more reckless driving during the pandemic.</p>\n<p>Also vital is improving air quality in low-income communities that are plagued by high asthma rates, like the Bronx, where residents have died of Covid-19 at far higher rates than the city as a whole. \u201cWe have smog in peoples\u2019 backyards,\u201d said Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whose district includes large swaths of the Bronx. \u201cIf you drive 40 minutes upstate, it\u2019s almost shocking what fresh air feels like. In some communities you just think it\u2019s normal that the air is just kind of heavier.\u201d</p>\n<p>Righting this injustice means having fewer and more efficient vehicles on the road. The city\u2019s plan to transition to electric buses by 2040 can happen sooner, and should begin in these neighborhoods. New York can also look toward building an electric fleet of sanitation trucks as that technology improves. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said the next mayor \u2014 Bill de Blasio\u2019s term is up next year \u2014 should reassess any tax cuts to companies and industries that bring heavy pollution with them. The city can improve the air quality in these communities even further by bringing back and significantly expanding a borough-based composting system to reduce waste that is inevitably diverted through transfer stations in the South Bronx, a shift that can also bring jobs to New Yorkers who need them.</p>\n<p>New York\u2019s mayor and congressional representatives need to fight hard in Washington for the infrastructure dollars the city needs. That\u2019s the only way the city can reinvest in its aging subway system, harden critical regional infrastructure and expand its bus network to areas of the city that are less accessible, like eastern Queens. Coaxing people out of their cars demands that these efforts succeed.</p>\n<p>Other changes need to be made to the roadways themselves. The city should move faster to build a thoroughly interconnected network of protected bike lanes. It also needs pedestrian and cyclist islands at dangerous intersections. More dedicated bus lanes and car-free avenues, like 14th Street in Manhattan, may help.</p>\n<p>A few small ideas: How about making New York\u2019s notorious trash problem part of the solution? Instead of letting those stinky piles of refuse pile up at the curb, why not put the city\u2019s trash into critter-proof enclosures placed between cyclists and cars? They could even have flower beds on top.</p>\n<p>The next mayor should feel free to get creative.</p>\n<p>Mitchell Moss, director of the Rudin Center for Transportation at New York University, said the key is to invest in public space in general. The city has some 1,700 parks and playgrounds, upon which New Yorkers have relied heavily during the pandemic. \u201cWe have to use our assets,\u201d Mr. Moss said. He added that the city would be smart to focus more resources in the outer-boroughs, which teemed with life even as large swaths of Manhattan emptied earlier this year. \u201cThe people who didn\u2019t leave this city have found a way to make this city more livable,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>With New York City facing a budget crisis, some changes will be difficult, or may take longer than they should. Change is generally difficult in New York, home to a political class that tends toward calcification.</p>\n<p>But amid unthinkable loss and suffering this year, lessons have been learned. Embracing those lessons is in some ways the greatest challenge facing New York, an old, proud city ready to be born anew.</p>\n<p>Jordan Gale is a freelance photographer. He moved to New York in February, and has been documenting the city throughout the year.</p>\n<p>The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

                "byline": "By David D. Kirkpatrick, Ronen Bergman and Farnaz Fassihi",
                "body": "<p>The raid alone was brazen enough. A team of Israeli commandos with high-powered torches blasted their way into a vault of a heavily guarded warehouse deep in Iran and made off before dawn with 5,000 pages of top secret papers on the country\u2019s nuclear program.</p>\n<p>Then in a television broadcast a few weeks later, in April 2018, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel cited the contents of the pilfered documents to hint coyly at equally bold operations still to come. \u201cRemember that name,\u201d he said, singling out the scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh as the captain of Iran\u2019s covert attempts to assemble a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>Now Mr. Fakhrizadeh has become the latest casualty in a campaign of audacious covert attacks seemingly designed to torment Iranian leaders with reminders of their weakness. The operations are confronting Tehran with an agonizing choice between embracing the demands of hard-liners for swift retaliation or attempting to make a fresh start with the less implacably hostile administration of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.</p>\n<p>Trailed by a carload of bodyguards, Mr. Fakhrizadeh was driving a carefully circuitous route to the home of his in-laws in the city of Absard, Iran, according to witnesses and the Iranian news media.</p>\n<p>An empty Nissan parked at a roundabout exploded, knocking down a power line. Gunmen leapt from a parked Hyundai Santa Fe, others arrived on motorcycles and waiting snipers filled out a hit team of 12 assassins, according to a detailed account posted online by Javad Mogouyi, a documentary filmmaker for Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.</p>\n<p>Mr. Fakhrizadeh, hit with at least three bullets, tumbled from his car and fell bleeding on the ground. The nearest medical clinic had lost electrical power. Roadside cameras were disabled. All 12 assassins escaped unharmed, and Mr. Fakhrizadeh was pronounced dead by the time a rescue helicopter was able to transport him to a Tehran hospital.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was like a Hollywood action movie,\u201d Mr. Mogouyi wrote in his account.</p>\n<p>It was the latest in a decade-long pattern of mysterious poisonings, car bombings, shootings, thefts and sabotage that have afflicted the Islamic Republic. Most have hit largely anonymous scientists or secretive facilities believed to be linked to its nuclear program, and almost all have been attributed by both American and Iranian officials to Tehran\u2019s great nemesis, Israel. Israeli officials \u2014 without formally acknowledging responsibility \u2014 have all but openly gloated over the repeated success of their spies.</p>\n<p>Never, however, has the Islamic Republic endured a spate of covert attacks quite like in 2020. In January, an American drone strike killed the revered general Qassim Suleimani as he was in a car leaving the Baghdad airport (an attack facilitated by Israel\u2019s intelligence, officials say). And Iran was humiliated in August by an Israeli hit team\u2019s fatal shooting of a senior Al Qaeda leader on the streets of Tehran (this time at the behest of the United States, its officials have said).</p>\n<p>Seldom has any country demonstrated a similar ability to strike with apparent impunity inside the territory of its fiercest enemy, said Bruce Riedel, a researcher at the Brookings Institution and a former official of the Central Intelligence Agency with experience in Israel.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it shows no sign of being effectively countered by the Iranians.\u201d</p>\n<p>With the killing Friday of its top nuclear scientist as well, Iranians are now grappling with a new sense of vulnerability and demands to purge suspected collaborators. Most of all, they are debating how to respond at a delicate moment.</p>\n<p>Iran has endured years of devastating economic sanctions under a campaign of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d from President Trump, and many Iranian leaders are desperately hoping for some measure of relief. President-elect Biden has pledged to seek to revive a lapsed agreement that lifted sanctions in exchange for a halt to nuclear research that might produce a weapon.</p>\n<p>To pragmatic Iranians, that possibility makes Mr. Trump\u2019s last months in office no time to lash back and risk renewed hostilities.</p>\n<p>But Iranians also know that their enemies in the United States and Israel may take advantage of this period to attack Tehran further. It is a chance to squeeze its leaders between domestic demands for revenge and a pragmatic desire for better relations.</p>\n<p>\u201cFrom today until Trump leaves the White House is the most dangerous period for Iran,\u201d Mohammad-Hossein Khoshvaght, a former official at the Ministry of Culture and Guidance, wrote in a message on Twitter.</p>\n<p>Retaliation against Israel or Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s main ally, the United States, would play into the hands of Iran\u2019s enemies in the region, Mr. Khoshvaght argued. They are seeking \u201cto create a difficult situation,\u201d so the new administration cannot revive that nuclear agreement, he added.</p>\n<p>Iranian hard-liners argued that the killing of Mr. Fakhrizadeh proved that holding out for a new start with Mr. Biden was only emboldening the country\u2019s foes.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t respond to this level of terrorism, they may repeat it because now they know Iran won\u2019t react,\u201d the conservative political analyst Foad Izadi said in an interview from Tehran.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is obviously a problem when you see these types of things repeating.\u201d</p>\n<p>Underscoring Mr. Fakhrizadeh\u2019s stature, the Iranian authorities announced plans on Saturday to give him the burial of a national hero at one of the country\u2019s holiest shrines.</p>\n<p>Videos circulated of a senior cleric who heads the judiciary praying with the scientist\u2019s family over his body shrouded in an Iranian flag and his face uncovered \u2014 an extraordinary and unexplained departure from the Islamic tradition of wrapping the dead in a white cloth from head to toe.</p>\n<p>Israel for decades has embraced a strategy of targeted assassinations in trying to slow down potential progress toward the development of a nuclear weapon among its hostile neighbors. Israeli intelligence agencies have been linked to the killings of scientists working for Egypt in the 1960s and for Iraq in the 1970s for the same reason, historians say.</p>\n<p>Iran first accused Israel of killing one of its scientists when he dropped dead in his laboratory after a poisoning in 2007, and a series of more violent attacks on Iranian scientists between 2010 and 2012 have been widely attributed to Israel, too.</p>\n<p>In one, a bomb in a parked motorcycle blew up a particle physicist as he was lowering a garage door at his home in Tehran. In three others, motorcyclists speeding past the moving cars of other scientists slapped magnetic bombs to their car doors, killing two and wounding a third. And in a fifth attack, gunmen on motorcycles sprayed a scientist with bullets while his car was stopped at a traffic light with his wife sitting beside him.</p>\n<p>Israel has developed a singularly successful track record in part by concentrating the considerable resources of its spy agencies mainly on Iran, its greatest nemesis, said Mr. Riedel of the Brookings Institution.</p>\n<p>Israel, he said, has also carefully cultivated ties within countries neighboring Iran as \u201cplatforms\u201d for surveillance and recruitment \u2014 most notably in Baku, Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan\u2019s recent conflict with Armenia has called attention to drones and other weaponry that Israel has furnished it as part of that relationship.</p>\n<p>Israel recruits native Farsi speakers from among Iranian immigrants to make contacts or analyze intercepted communications, he added, and Israel has managed to enlist a steady stream of Iranian collaborators.</p>\n<p>Now, Mr. Riedel argued, the attack on Mr. Fakhrizadeh may be an indication that Israel plans other killings. After an eight-year \u201chiatus\u201d since the wave of assassinations from 2010 to 2012, he said, \u201cI think it is a signal that the game is afoot, or coming.\u201d</p>\n<p>Speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss covert operations, a senior Israeli official involved for years in tracking Mr. Fakhrizadeh said Israel would continue to act against the Iranian nuclear program as necessary. Iran\u2019s aspirations for nuclear weapons, promoted by Mr. Fakhrizadeh, posed such a menace that the world should thank Israel, the official insisted.</p>\n<p>In Iran, the killing has already elicited new demands to root out spies, including from the country\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p>\n<p>In his first public response to the killing, Ayatollah Khamenei declared that Iran\u2019s first priority was \u201cinvestigating this crime and definitive punishment of its perpetrators.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hard-liners blamed the administration of Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani \u2014 a pragmatist who had bet heavily on negotiations with Washington \u2014 for the security failures that allowed the attack.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe night is long and we are awake,\u201d said Hossein Dehghan, a recently announced candidate in next year\u2019s presidential election who is a senior commander of the Revolutionary Guards and the defense adviser to Ayatollah Khamenei.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe will come down like thunder on the heads of those responsible for the murder of this martyr and make them regret it,\u201d he continued in a message on Twitter.</p>\n<p>Mr. Rouhani, for his part, suggested in a televised speech that Iran would continue what he has called a policy of \u201cstrategic patience,\u201d or what his critics call waiting for Mr. Biden.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe will answer at the right time,\u201d Mr. Rouhani said. \u201cAll the enemies should know that the great Iranian people are more courageous and honorable to not respond to this criminal act.\u201d</p>\n<p>But within Iranian politics, analysts said, the hard-liners stood to gain the most politically from the attack. Any renewed conflict with Israel bolsters their case against negotiation with its allies in the West, said Sanam Vakil at Chatham House in London.</p>\n<p>Since Mr. Biden won the November election, the hard-liners have begun pushing against Mr. Rouhani to defer any negotiations with the new American administration for as long as possible, Ms. Vakil said. Conflict with Washington strengthens their appeal and weakens more pragmatic factions in the Iranian election coming next year.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo an event like this plays in the hands of the hard-liners,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause they can push out negotiations until after the Iranian election \u2014 and that is what they are gunning for.\u201d</p>"

                "byline": "By Norimitsu Onishi, Constant M\u00e9heut and Antonella Francini",
                "body": "<p>PARIS \u2014 As a second lockdown appeared inevitable amid skyrocketing coronavirus infections, the scientists advising the French government in October warned that keeping students in their classrooms meant it would take longer to tame the surge.</p>\n<p>The government kept the schools open anyway, even as the country became an epicenter of the second wave of the coronavirus in Europe. French leaders decided that they would try to subdue the surge, while also trying to minimize economic and academic damage by keeping children learning where they do it best: in school.</p>\n<p>Five weeks into a second nationwide lockdown, France, like much of Europe, has proved that it is possible to bring the rate of known infections down, even with schools open.</p>\n<p>It is a lesson that has been taken up late in the United States, where Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and other cities, have made it a priority to keep bars and restaurants open \u2014 though not necessarily for indoor service or at full capacity \u2014 even as they have closed their schools.</p>\n<p>Many European countries, including France, have made the opposite choice: keeping schools open but closing restaurants and bars.</p>\n<p>In France, 11 percent of coronavirus tests are coming back positive but students have kept going to school, while New York City shut its public schools on Nov. 19, after the positive test rate reached 3 percent.</p>\n<p>But recent studies have shown that young children, at least, are low transmitters of the virus, and at least some American officials are reconsidering their approach: Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York abruptly decided on Sunday to reopen elementary schools while keeping upper grades closed, and other districts around the country have made or announced similar moves.</p>\n<p>Allowing schools to remain open has been one of the most significant departures from Europe\u2019s initial lockdowns last spring.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe first lockdown was horrible,\u201d said Marine Huguenin, who was watching her two daughters play at a Paris park, which was filled with strollers and masked parents after school on a recent afternoon.</p>\n<p>During the earlier lockdown, the entire family was stuck inside, she said, with Ms. Huguenin and her husband looking after their children during the day, then catching up on work between 9:30 p.m. and 1 a.m.</p>\n<p>The numbers tell the story of France\u2019s progress so far. In early November, the number of new cases in France in a seven-day period soared to more than 80 per 100,000 people; as of Sunday it had dropped to 17 per 100,000.</p>\n<p>\u201cObviously, the decline has been slower because schools are open, but we had to find a middle ground,\u201d said Yazdan Yazdanpanah, an infectious disease specialist and a member of France\u2019s Scientific Council, which advises the government on the pandemic. But, he added, the slower drop in infections has been offset by positive effects on education, mental health and the economy.</p>\n<p>The trade-off has been generally well-accepted in an otherwise contentious lockdown during which an increasing number of people have challenged restrictions on movement and business.</p>\n<p>In Paris, keeping schools open has shifted the mood in a city that lived through one of the world\u2019s strictest lockdowns in the spring.</p>\n<p>At the time, Paris felt like a ghost town, with every inch of the city \u2014 from small residential streets to the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es \u2014 deserted. This time, things seem much nearer to normal. Chairs are stacked inside closed cafes and restaurants. But neighborhoods come to life in the mornings and afternoons as parents take their children to and from school, and older students linger on sidewalks with studied indifference.</p>\n<p>Clusters have appeared in schools throughout France, though not in \u201cworrying numbers,\u201d said Dr. Yazdanpanah, the infectious disease specialist.</p>\n<p>With classrooms open, parents have been able to focus on work at home or commute to their workplaces, which has helped blunt the second lockdown\u2019s blow to the economy.</p>\n<p>The Bank of France estimated that economic activity this month would be 12 percent below normal \u2014 far less than the 31 percent drop experienced in April.</p>\n<p>Most European countries, including Britain, France, Germany and Spain, have kept schools open even as the continent remains among the worst-hit. A few countries, like Austria, the Czech Republic and Italy, have closed schools, in part or in full.</p>\n<p>In France, as in much of the world, schools shut down during the first wave in the spring as scientists tried to figure out what role children played in transmitting the virus.</p>\n<p>The country\u2019s 12 million students in primary and secondary schools engaged in online learning, but soon, teachers and education officials warned that many children had fallen behind.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt reinforced our conviction to keep the schools open, for education and social reasons,\u201d said Sophie V\u00e9n\u00e9titay, a teacher and union official.</p>\n<h3>Schools During Coronavirus \u203a</h3>\n<h4>Back to School</h4>\n<p>Updated Nov. 27, 2020</p>\n<p>The latest on how the pandemic is reshaping education.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, new studies suggested that despite early fears, keeping schools open, while not without risk, could be relatively safe so long as rules to limit the spread of the virus were in place.</p>\n<p>In August, a report released by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control said evidence \u201cindicates that closures of child care and educational institutions are unlikely to be an effective single control measure for community transmission of Covid-19.\u201d</p>\n<p>Most studies on transmission now suggest that children younger than 10 spread the virus less efficiently than adults do, but that teenagers become infected and spread the virus just as much as adults. So keeping high schools open safely is trickier, especially if community transmission is high \u2014 making social distancing rules even more important.</p>\n<p>After reining in the first wave of the epidemic, France saw infections begin rising again in August as people resumed socializing and the government failed to effectively carry out public health measures of testing, tracing and isolating.</p>\n<p>By October, infections were skyrocketing across most of Europe.</p>\n<p>But even after a warning from his scientific advisers, President Emmanuel Macron announced that France\u2019s schools would remain open, as nonessential businesses were ordered closed. \u201cOur children cannot be permanently deprived of instruction, education, contact with the school system,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Henri Bergeron, a sociologist at the Paris Institute of Political Studies, the elite university known as Sciences Po, and a co-author of a book, \u201cCovid-19: An Organizational Crisis,\u201d said: \u201cThis time, health priority is mixed with economic priority.\u201d</p>\n<p>To address concerns as cases ballooned, education officials slightly tightened rules, including lowering the age for mandatory mask-wearing to 6 years old from 11. Many schools staggered hours for parents to drop off and pick up their children, and have adjusted lunch periods to lessen crowding. In many high schools, students now take turns, spending half their days in school and the rest at home.</p>\n<p>Three months into France\u2019s school year, schools have not become a major driver of infections, according to health experts. And the number of students who tested positive in the seven days that ended on Thursday dropped 44 percent from the week before, according to figures released by the Education Ministry. The latest figure translates to 0.06 percent of the 12 million schoolchildren in France.</p>\n<p>On Friday, out of 61,500 schools nationwide, only 19 primary schools, three middle schools and three high schools were closed because of outbreaks.</p>\n<p>Outside Turgot High School in Paris, small groups of students chatted and smoked after the end of their classes on a recent afternoon. Some said they thought students were being infected outside school, when they met on weekends, sometimes at classmates\u2019 parties.</p>\n<p>Jeanne Piffaut, 17, said she found it hard studying alone and being unable to ask her teachers questions in person.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m worried that the situation will get worse,\u201d she said, \u201cand that schools end up closing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Reporting was contributed by Allison McCann in London, Monica Davey in Chicago, Ellen Barry in Boston, Thomas Fuller in San Francisco, and Apoorva Mandavilli, Eliza Shapiro and Sarah Mervosh in New York.</p>"

                "subheadline": "The \u201cMean Girls\u201d and \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d actress knows her performance as Marion Davies in\u201cMank\u201d will be a turning point in her career. But first, she had to put some distance between herself and Hollywood.",
                "byline": "By Kyle Buchanan",
                "body": "<p>The goats didn\u2019t want to go out in the morning, Amanda Seyfried said. There was one in particular that was giving her trouble, the one Seyfried described as the \u201cGod-knows-how-big-she-is goat.\u201d This one was spoiling for a fight. This one could not be moved.</p>\n<p>So what did Seyfried do? She got in that goat shed, planted her feet and pushed.</p>\n<p>The goat pushed back, of course. That\u2019s the thing about goats: They\u2019re stubborn. They also have horns, and Amanda Seyfried, a 34-year-old actress, does not.</p>\n<p>It was frustrating. It was exhausting. It was also, Seyfried hastened to add, completely awesome.</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s one of the primary reasons Seyfried lives on a farm in the Catskills instead of in some overpriced condo on the Sunset Strip: A morning tussle with your goats has the ability to put just about everything else into perspective. \u201cIt\u2019s insane how much I can feel so accomplished and successful here without having to be in a successful movie,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>Seyfried shares the farm with several chickens, horses of wildly varying sizes, a donkey named Gus, those goats, her actor husband, Thomas Sadoski, and their two children. That last bit somehow proved the most surprising: During a week of conversations over Zoom, Seyfried wore no makeup and looked scarcely older than the breathy ditz she played in \u201cMean Girls\u201d (2004) or the singing bride from \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d (2008). But she is a mother now, a farmer and, for the first time in her career, a significant Oscar contender.</p>\n<p>In Netflix\u2019s new drama \u201cMank,\u201d directed by David Fincher and due Friday on Netflix, Seyfried plays Marion Davies, the 1920s and \u201930s screen star better known today as the mistress of the newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst. It\u2019s a relationship that would be fictionalized for Orson Welles\u2019s roman \u00e0 clef \u201cCitizen Kane,\u201d and \u201cMank\u201d chronicles that process, as the screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz (Gary Oldman) reminisces about the years he spent partying at Hearst\u2019s San Simeon estate, a glittery Shangri-La where Davies became a confidante with whom he could share gossip and gin.</p>\n<p>Seyfried has just a handful of scenes in \u201cMank,\u201d but she still walks away with the movie, playing Davies as gratifyingly sly and self-aware, a brassy, no-airs girl from Brooklyn who has been plopped into a castle by Hearst and is determined to make the most of it. Davies throws parties, drinks too much and often says the wrong thing, but when you say the wrong thing in upper-crust circles, it just means you\u2019ve told some wealthy men the truth, and the girl can\u2019t help it.</p>\n<p>When Marion\u2019s not onscreen, you wish she was, but Seyfried is not used to being deemed the standout: When reading the rave reviews for \u201cFirst Reformed\u201d (2018), in which she played a pregnant widow beseeching Ethan Hawke\u2019s conflicted pastor, Seyfried was happy just to get an honorable mention. She has found that most of the time when critics name her, it\u2019s in a parenthetical telling you who played the daughter or the girlfriend. \u201cSkating through like that has been my experience, mostly,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>This sort of disarming frankness comes naturally to Seyfried, whose big blue eyes get even wider when she reminisces about making \u201cMank\u201d but narrow slightly whenever she makes a self-assessment. She can\u2019t help but wonder if directors wrote her off after mainstream romantic dramas like \u201cDear John\u201d or \u201cLetters to Juliet\u201d (both from 2010), and she often derides herself as \u201clazy\u201d for playing a version of herself in those movies. It\u2019s important to Seyfried that an audience likes her; she is working on liking herself.</p>\n<p>Despite her fair share of hits, Seyfried was still shocked when she ran into Quentin Tarantino at the airport recently and he knew who she was. \u201cKeep your expectations low,\u201d she told me, \u201cand you\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised.\u201d Last fall, when her agent relayed that Fincher had her in mind for \u201cMank,\u201d Seyfried\u2019s eyes filled with tears. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice to be respected by somebody that you think is just a one-of-a-kind master of his domain,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>In a phone interview, Fincher compared Seyfried to Cameron Diaz \u2014 a mainstream comedienne who was always capable of giving more, even if she was rarely asked for it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe all knew that Amanda was luminescent, we all knew that she was effervescent, we all knew that she was funny,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all knew that she understood how to parse or set up a joke, and we all knew that she could be moving. I think the thing that was ultimately surprising was the mercurial nature of how quickly she could scramble through those things, because it gives Marion this whole other dimension.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fincher is famous for shooting dozens upon dozens of takes, a process that can frustrate movie stars who are used to nailing their lines and moving on. Seyfried found his method to be a dream. She wasn\u2019t rushed, she wasn\u2019t discounted. Finally, she had the space to see what she was made of. \u201cIt was my turn,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was me.\u201d</p>\n<p>WHAT MADE SEYFRIED pursue acting in the first place? \u201cI\u2019m still sorting this out with my therapist,\u201d she said. But she sees a lot of herself in her 3-year-old daughter, Nina, who is creative, quick to express herself and eager for affirmation. Becoming a mother has often prodded Seyfried to look back on the arc of her own life, and from her vantage point in the Catskills, things play a little differently now.</p>\n<p>After a pleasant childhood in Allentown, Pa., where her film-buff father got Seyfried hooked on Laurel and Hardy comedies and classics like \u201cNosferatu,\u201d she spent her teenage years commuting to New York City to film episodes of the soap operas \u201cAs the World Turns\u201d and \u201cAll My Children.\u201d Some actresses take forever to land their first breakthrough credit. Seyfried\u2019s first movie was \u201cMean Girls.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s a pretty heady beginning for someone who\u2019s still trying to figure herself out. All Seyfried knew back then is that she loved the attention, loved earning a laugh, and loved making people feel something. And when she was young, she was eager to use all of herself in every role.</p>\n<p>Maybe that\u2019s why she was successful so early. Blessed with those big eyes and an intimate, immediate connection with the camera, it wasn\u2019t hard for Seyfried to convince you she was feeling something: She really, really was. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever unpacked what that did to me emotionally,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>Her tendency to burn brightly and her lifelong eagerness to please has sometimes made her an easy mark, she knows now. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have boundaries, then you\u2019re screwed in this industry,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is a scary place for a young person, somebody who doesn\u2019t have a backbone \u2014 which was me. And I paid for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>She recalled a job she booked when she was still a teenager, where the director asked her to appear nearly nude onscreen. Without anyone else on set to advocate for her, she reluctantly agreed to take her clothes off.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have been put in very insane positions,\u201d she said. \u201cI was walking around with no underpants on and a T-shirt, and I didn\u2019t want to be, yet I didn\u2019t feel like I had any power to say, \u2018No, this makes me uncomfortable.\u2019\u201d (She wouldn\u2019t name the project.)</p>\n<p>That\u2019s part of why at 22, Seyfried began looking at houses outside Hollywood. As her career kept heating up, she needed to her draw her own boundaries, to remind herself that a set is not home, that home is home. Seven years ago, coming off roles in \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d and \u201cLovelace,\u201d she finally happened across the farm in the Catskills and knew it was what she had long been searching for.</p>\n<p>Her business manager demurred, but Seyfried put her foot down: \u201cI was like, \u2018No, Mark! I\u2019m telling you, this is where I\u2019m going to die.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>Later, she met, married and moved in Sadoski, and children would eventually be added to the farm\u2019s menagerie, including a son born in September. Spending the last few years in the Catskills has \u201csolidified my need to be out of the game when I\u2019m not working, to be in nature and to refresh,\u201d Seyfried said. \u201cEverybody needs a center of gravity. Somewhere to feel safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>Safety is a priority for Seyfried, and she wants it to be a priority for Hollywood, too. She was reminded of this over the summer during a contentious vote to ratify the new Screen Actors Guild contract. \u201cThere was a lot of infighting, and it was really hard to know where I stood,\u201d she said. Ultimately, Seyfried voted no, because she felt the contract didn\u2019t do enough to protect actors who are shooting intimate scenes: \u201cI just feel like really, this industry is not as safe as it wants to be.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ten years ago, Seyfried might have been too afraid to go against the grain, especially because her fellow actors still voted overwhelmingly to ratify the contract. But it can be a good thing to take a righteous stand: It means you know yourself and your own priorities, and finally, Seyfried thinks she does. No matter how her \u201cMank\u201d performance fares this awards season, all the time she has spent on her farm this year has given Seyfried the ability to see these things much more clearly.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis movie is definitely the best opportunity I\u2019ve had in my career, and it is absolutely shifting my career for the better,\u201d she said. \u201cBut without it, I was just as happy, because I\u2019ve made space for myself to feel accomplished in my own world.\u201d</p>\n<p>Later, Seyfried would text me a photo from the shed where she\u2019d had her morning clash. I could see most of her goats milling around in the distance, but one had gotten right up in the lens, defiantly staring the camera down with wide-set eyes. It looked stubborn as hell. It looked like it wouldn\u2019t be easily led. And I knew why Amanda Seyfried had loved the fight.</p>"

                "body": "<p>If she could travel back in time, before she was suspended from gymnastics after being accused of berating and mistreating her athletes, including an Olympic champion, Maggie Haney says she would change the way she coached.</p>\n<p>She wouldn\u2019t push some of her young gymnasts to redo a routine again and again after even the tiniest mistakes. To demand their focus, she wouldn\u2019t yell at them. Instead she would learn to let some imperfections slide.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think my mistakes were that I cared too much, and wanted them to be a little too perfect every day, when maybe that\u2019s not possible,\u201d Haney, one of the most prominent coaches in the sport, said this month in an interview with The New York Times, the first time she has spoken publicly in nearly a year. \u201cMaybe what used to be OK is not OK anymore, and maybe it shouldn\u2019t be. I think maybe the culture has shifted.\u201d</p>\n<p>Haney has not coached at her gym in central New Jersey or anywhere else since February, she said, when U.S.A. Gymnastics, the sport\u2019s national federation, temporarily suspended her before later barring her from coaching for eight years for what it called her \u201csevere aggressive behavior\u201d toward her athletes. She said she hasn\u2019t even coached her own daughter, who is 11.</p>\n<p>The athletes who have trained under Haney include Laurie Hernandez, who won a silver medal on the balance beam at the 2016 Olympics and helped the United States win the team gold medal.</p>\n<p>Hernandez\u2019s complaint to the federation was one of nearly a dozen that led to Haney\u2019s ban, which she is appealing to an arbitrator. It was considered the harshest penalty for emotional and verbal abuse in the sport\u2019s recent history.</p>\n<p>The suspension was also viewed as a warning that coaches could now face stiff penalties for the mental and nonsexual abuse that was long accepted in the sport before the Lawrence G. Nassar sexual abuse scandal shed light on the toxic culture in gymnastics. Nassar was the longtime United States national team doctor who in 2018 was sentenced to prison for molesting more than 200 girls and women under the guise of medical treatment.</p>\n<p>Haney said the accusations against her \u2014 particularly those from Hernandez, whom she coached from age 6 \u2014 had come out of nowhere, and she vehemently denied them. More than 30 gymnasts at MG Elite, Haney\u2019s gym in Morganville, N.J., and their families continue to support her and are awaiting her return to the sport, she said. Some have voiced their support for Haney in a YouTube video compiled by the public-relations firm she hired to help restore her reputation.</p>\n<p>Haney, 42, said she was convinced that U.S.A. Gymnastics had used her as a scapegoat after its missteps in the Nassar case, in which the organization failed to protect its gymnasts from a sexual predator. The federation needed to do \u201csomething bold, something dramatic,\u201d she said, to prove to the public that it cares about its athletes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve dedicated my whole life to this,\u201d Haney said, her voice beginning to waver. \u201cTo be out of the gym has been really hard. I feel like it was unfairly taken away from me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Haney\u2019s accusers have not wavered. They say the ban is warranted, and some even wanted a permanent one. They claim that she bullied her gymnasts, publicly shamed them about their weight, encouraged eating disorders and forced them to train with injuries.</p>\n<p>Hernandez, who is now training in California for the Tokyo Olympics next summer, told The Times in April that Haney\u2019s treatment of her was \u201cjust so twisted that I thought it couldn\u2019t be real.\u201d She said the abuse included Haney calling her weak, lazy and messed up in the head and that the emotional abuse led to a continuing battle with depression.</p>\n<p>Riley McCusker, who has a good chance of making the United States team for the Tokyo Games, filed a lawsuit against Haney last month. Among the accusations in the complaint was that Haney had forced McCusker to train through injuries, including while she had a painful, potentially serious medical condition called rhabdomyolysis, which is a breakdown of muscle tissue that can happen from overexertion.</p>\n<p>In a separate lawsuit filed last month, another gymnast, Emily Liszewski, a sophomore at the University of Pittsburgh, accused Haney and an assistant coach of forcing her to perform an advanced skill on the uneven bars at the Arena Gym, a gym not far from MG Elite, and it led her to fall and hit her head. Liszewski was unconscious for three days, with multiple skull fractures, and had seizures because of the injury, the lawsuit said. The suit also claimed that Haney once picked Liszewski up from the floor by her hair after the gymnast had fallen.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese situations are not at all the way I recall them,\u201d Haney said, adding that Hernandez\u2019s mother and McCusker\u2019s mother were often in the gym \u2014 sometimes on the training floor \u2014 but never expressed displeasure over her demanding coaching style. (Neither mother responded to a request made through a representative to comment for this article.)</p>\n<p>Haney added: \u201cI just think when money gets involved, people will say and do different things. I think a lot of this is about money.\u201d</p>\n<p>The arbitrator\u2019s ruling on Haney\u2019s appeal is expected in the coming days, said one of her lawyers, Steven Altman. He said he hoped that Haney\u2019s suspension would be rescinded because U.S.A. Gymnastics\u2019s hearing for the case had been biased and flawed, and \u201cas a practical matter, a kangaroo court.\u201d Seven of Haney\u2019s accusers were not even coached by her, Altman said, and the gym offered a fun environment amid the intense training that is generally needed to master the sport\u2019s daring moves.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen they were doing gymnastics, it was serious,\u201d Altman said. \u201cThey worked on life-threatening skills for hours a day.\u201d</p>\n<p>U.S.A. Gymnastics, in an emailed statement, said on Sunday that Haney\u2019s hearing was \u201cboth fair and impartial, and adhered to the requirements\u201d of the organization\u2019s procedures, as well as the law that oversees Olympic sports in the United States.</p>\n<p>Haney conceded she could be intense in the gym. But she said that most of the time \u201ceverybody is smiling and laughing and music is playing.\u201d She carefully crafted the atmosphere at the gym, she said, knowing that parents had entrusted her with their children, at times from morning until evening. The program, Haney said, included closely monitored online learning, a certified teacher holding classes during the day and an emphasis on safety.</p>\n<p>As a young gymnast herself, training in an elite program for a while, Haney worked with harsh coaches who screamed at the girls, she recalled, and had them step onto a scale daily, then listed everyone\u2019s weight on a bulletin board in the gym. To make the girls lose weight, the coaches forced them to wear rubber suits or 20-pound belts and jog around the gym, she said.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t faze me and didn\u2019t bother me, but that kid next to me, it could\u2019ve really bothered and scared them,\u201d she said, adding that she never weighed her gymnasts or forced them to lose weight. \u201cI think what I\u2019ve learned over the last year is that so much of this comes down to perspective. Every person. Every athlete. Every coach. They have their own perspective of things.\u201d</p>\n<p>Some of the families whose children continue to train at MG Elite were drawn to her gym because of what they described as an exacting nature.</p>\n<p>Henry Rivera, an engineer at a software company, moved his 12-year-old daughter to MG Elite last year so she could train with Haney. He said she had left her previous gym because her routines were getting sloppy and the coach there was pushing her to perform skills she didn\u2019t feel prepared to do.</p>\n<p>Rivera said he appreciated that Haney had made the gym a safe space for his daughter, yet never babied her.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I wanted her to come home happy and smiling every day, I\u2019d send her to clown school; I\u2019m serious,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cIf my daughter has goals and her goal is to be an elite athlete, I need a coach to teach her the right things and safely, and to push them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rivera said if Haney ever was abusive to his daughter, he would have noticed because he monitors what she is going through \u201cemotionally, mentally and physically,\u201d considering it his job as a parent.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs parents, we need to be vigilant,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t like it, get up and leave.\u201d</p>\n<p>In a telephone interview with her parents standing by, his daughter, Hezly, said Haney just wanted her gymnasts to be the best and was tough on them, \u201cbut not like to the point where it was horrible.\u201d She said that she was sad to see Haney go and that she missed her.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe never crossed the line,\u2019\u2019 she said.</p>\n<p>Another parent at the gym, Charisse Dash, is a sports agent who recruits athletes from the Dominican Republic to play in Major League Baseball. Her 10-year-old daughter has worked with Haney since she was 6.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not there to play, you\u2019re there to work,\u201d Dash said, describing that type of gymnastics as \u201ca 9-to-5 job.\u201d</p>\n<p>She added: \u201cDo I classify the rigor of the training as abuse? I think you really have to see it on a case-by-case basis.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dash said she and her husband ran \u201ca very tight ship\u201d at home with their five children, where screaming, not coddling, was common. So, to them, Haney\u2019s demanding style was a great fit.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to say that Maggie is an abuser, by all means,\u201d Dash said. \u201cIt depends on how much any child or any person can tolerate.\u201d</p>\n<p>Haney\u2019s U.S.A. Gymnastics hearing in February and March was held by telephone, and Haney listened to weeks of it while huddled in a closet so her two children would not interrupt her. About a half-dozen parents testified in support of her, but not all of the parents who wanted to testify were given the chance to, she said. Even when Haney herself testified, she said, she felt that her side of the story didn\u2019t matter. She was sure the three-person hearing panel had already made up its mind.</p>\n<p>Some of the gymnasts who accused her of abuse, she said, had been asked to leave the gym because they could not physically keep up. The part she remembers as the worst, though, was sitting through Hernandez\u2019s live testimony. Haney considered their relationship strong, so it was inconceivable to her that Hernandez felt mistreated.</p>\n<p>Hernandez often slept at Haney\u2019s house and was considered a part of the family, Haney said. Haney took Hernandez to the beach, to restaurants, to get her nails done, and gave her a tuition break at the gym. When she and Hernandez returned from the 2016 Olympics, Haney said, she helped organize a parade in her town, in Hernandez\u2019s honor.</p>\n<p>When Hernandez was competing on the television show \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d soon after the Rio Games, Haney said, she spoke to her one night for three hours. The coach remembered their talking like old friends, about makeup and music and how Haney, with her perfectionist\u2019s eye, noticed that Hernandez\u2019s foot had slipped during an earlier dance, but that she had covered the mistake well. Haney recalled telling Hernandez to enjoy her break from gymnastics.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a star now,\u201d Haney said she told her.</p>\n<p>Within days, Laurie Hernandez\u2019s mother, Wanda, called Haney to say that they were cutting all ties. Though Wanda Hernandez told The Times in April that she had severed the relationship after learning that Haney had mistreated her daughter, Haney said she was blindsided by the move and now thinks it was financially motivated because the Hernandezes first offered her a cut of Laurie\u2019s income after the Olympics, but then did not follow through.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor me, it was never about the money,\u201d Haney said. \u201cI just remember being so confused and not understanding any of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Neither Wanda nor Laurie Hernandez responded to interview requests made through Laurie\u2019s agent, Sheryl Shade.</p>\n<p>The situation left Haney wondering what she had done wrong. She said she had been protective of her gymnasts, even when it came to food, as she watched other coaches at meets hover over the meal table to control their athletes\u2019 consumption.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy kids were never the ones stuffing bread into their pockets,\u201d she said, describing how some athletes felt compelled to sneak food back to their rooms.</p>\n<p>She said she encouraged her gymnasts to make smart choices, though McCusker\u2019s lawsuit said Haney promoted unhealthy eating and weight-loss habits.</p>\n<p>Haney acknowledged that there had recently been a change in how some gymnasts expected to be treated by their coaches, especially since this summer, when hundreds of them worldwide began speaking out about the abuse they endured from tyrannical coaches.</p>\n<p>Many coaches, Haney said, now don\u2019t know when they might cross the line or upset an especially sensitive child or parent, so they \u201care just letting the girls do whatever because they don\u2019t want to get in trouble.\u201d </p>\n<p>The culture has shifted perhaps too far, she said, and she expects the sport, going forward, to be filled with underachievers. She said she thinks coaches will not push their athletes as hard.</p>\n<p>Haney blames parents for that. They have become too invested in their daughters\u2019 success, she said, and now are emboldened to lash out at anyone \u2014 and potentially crush anyone \u2014 who stands in their daughters\u2019 way.</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel that somebody needs to stand up for coaches,\u201d Haney said. \u201cIf I don\u2019t stand up and fight for the truth, then other coaches aren\u2019t going to, either. I know if this can happen to me, I think it can happen to anyone.\u201d</p>"

                "byline": "By Elizabeth Paton and Vanessa Friedman",
                "body": "<p>In 2015, the chairman and controlling shareholder of the luxury goods group Richemont, Johann Rupert, took to the stage at an industry conference in Monte Carlo and issued a rallying cry to some of his biggest rivals.</p>\n<p>\u201cI invited the other big groups to create a singular, dominant neutral platform for the luxury goods industry in which we were shareholders,\u201d Mr. Rupert, a blustery South African, recalled this month. \u201cI was talking to Mr. Arnault of LVMH and Mr. Pinault of Kering,\u201d he said, referring to the heads of two major luxury conglomerates, Bernard Arnault and Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault. \u201cI told them the future of luxury retail lay online as well as offline, and that it was too big a game for any company to try to dominate.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Rupert then added with a sigh, \u201cAs usual, everyone wanted to do it themselves.\u201d</p>\n<p>Five years on and the coronavirus pandemic has revealed just how important e-commerce is to the future of luxury goods. Unlike the music industry, which has Spotify, or the hotel business, which has Booking.com, the luxury fashion industry is still without a single dominant online player.</p>\n<p>But this month, Richemont, which owns Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels, and the Chinese technology titan Alibaba announced that they were making a $1.1 billion investment in the online fashion retailer Farfetch. The Pinault family, whose company, Kering, owns Gucci, Saint Laurent and Alexander McQueen, also increased its stake in Farfetch by $50 million through its investment vehicle Art\u00e9mis.</p>\n<p>The move united two of the biggest groups in luxury in common cause and potentially formed a bridge between two of the dominant luxury e-commerce platforms: Farfetch and Yoox Net-a-Porter, also owned by Richemont. It also set the stage for a potential realignment of the online retail landscape, currently suspended between the poles of Amazon and Alibaba, as luxury gravitates toward the ever-increasing might of the Chinese consumer market.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe pandemic has shone the spotlight on online fashion in a big way as an area for growth, and a category leader will definitely emerge in the next five years,\u201d said Chris Morton, the founder of Lyst, the fashion search platform, whose sales have grown \u201cin the triple digits\u201d since the start of the year. \u201cThis is the fight to the top we are running.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, agreed. \u201cA supreme luxury e-commerce group is a compelling idea, but no one so far has been able to pull it off,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Could that be about to change?</p>\n<h2>The Amazon Incursion</h2>\n<p>For the last decade, the Western luxury e-commerce landscape has largely been dominated by Farfetch \u2014 an inventory-free marketplace platform founded by Jos\u00e9 Neves in 2007 \u2014 and Yoox Net-a-Porter, the largest of the wholesalers, which was created in 2015 after a merger between Yoox and Net-a-Porter. </p>\n<p>Luxury brands were late to embrace e-commerce. When they did, many depended on either Farfetch or Yoox, rejecting the overtures of giants like Amazon. Partly, this was because of Amazon\u2019s reputation as \u201cthe everything store,\u201d which clashed with the luxury industry\u2019s emphasis on exclusivity. Cases of third-party sellers offering counterfeit goods on Amazon also were a contributing factor. A spokeswoman for the company said that \u201cAmazon strictly prohibits the sale of counterfeit products\u201d and \u201cinvests heavily in both funds and company energy to ensure our policy is followed.\u201d She pointed out that the company has pursued cases against counterfeiters in partnership with Valentino, among other brands.</p>\n<p>When the pandemic forced many stores to close, however, brands had no choice but to focus on digital sales \u2014 and the more-established platforms for digital customers. According to data released last week by the management consulting firm Bain & Company, online luxury purchases were worth $58 billion in 2020, compared with $39 billion in 2019, nearly doubling the sector\u2019s share of the market for global luxury sales to 23 percent from 12 percent.</p>\n<p>\u201cLuxury e-commerce is now in an environment of rapid mutation,\u201d said Claudia D\u2019Arpizio, a luxury consultant at Bain. Few contenders have become profitable, she said, despite being pumped full of investment.</p>\n<p>Moving to take advantage of the moment, Amazon embarked on two initiatives. First, it unveiled special storefronts in both the United States and Europe between May and October. Created in conjunction with Vogue and local fashion councils, both storefronts showcased the work of independent designers who had been left without an outlet when department stores canceled orders. Second it introduced a new Luxury Stores app geared toward Amazon\u2019s 150 million Prime subscribers.</p>\n<p>\u201cI would guess that somewhere near 100 percent of our existing customers are on Amazon and a huge percentage of those are Prime members,\u201d Alex Bolen, chief executive of Oscar de la Renta, Amazon\u2019s Luxury Stores first partner and guinea pig, said to Vogue in September. \u201cFor me to get more mind share with existing customers in addition to getting new customers \u2014 that\u2019s the name of the game. We want to be able to talk to her wherever she\u2019s comfortable shopping.\u201d</p>\n<p>Other brands, such as Roland Mouret and Altuzarra, have joined, and Amazon said more brands were expected to come on board in the first quarter of next year. As with Farfetch and Luxury Pavilion, an invitation-only luxury platform on Alibaba\u2019s Tmall site, participating brands control how their goods are presented on the app, allaying fears about Amazon\u2019s utilitarian interface and lack of selectivity. Amazon also bolstered its fashion credentials by hiring Sally Singer, Vogue\u2019s former digital creative director and an editor with deep ties to the designer community, as its new head of fashion direction.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Cohen, a New York designer who joined the Amazon independent designers initiative in May, said it helped get his business through the initial lockdown, but he nevertheless opted not to continue once the special storefront was dissolved in early October (as planned) and the designers who chose to continue became part of the main Amazon platform.</p>\n<p>According to Mr. Cohen, the brand had received \u201cmessages from customers asking why such expensive pieces were selling on Amazon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yet going it alone is also increasingly untenable. LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the largest luxury group in the world, has publicly rejected the idea of working with Amazon, but even its proprietary solution \u2014 the wholesale platform 24 S\u00e8vres, created in 2017, with an exclusive arrangement with Dior and C\u00e9line \u2014 has not gotten meaningful traction with consumers, and it continues to lose money. (The group also made a multimillion-dollar investment in Lyst in 2018.)</p>\n<p>\u201cThe term \u2018platform\u2019 is intoxicating at first blush, but at second, it\u2019s a license to spend tens of billions of dollars before you see any return,\u201d Mr. Galloway, the New York University professor, said.</p>\n<p>Enter the Farfetch alliance.</p>\n<h2>The New Alliance</h2>\n<p>Farfetch, which went public in 2018, has a business model that includes an e-commerce marketplace for brick-and-mortar boutiques, and it works directly with brands on their back-end technology and logistics. It also has direct brand ownership thanks to a $675 million acquisition of New Guards Group, which manufactures and distributes brands like Off-White and Palm Angels. This month, the company also reported a record quarter. The value of goods sold reached $798 million in the three months ending Sept. 30, a 62 percent increase from the same period a year earlier. Gross profit was up 82 percent, edging the 13-year-old company toward profitability in 2021.</p>\n<p>Mr. Neves of Farfetch acknowledges that Amazon is his leading competitor in the race for luxury e-commerce supremacy, so it makes sense that he would team up with its greatest international rival, Alibaba.</p>\n<p>The new Richemont-Alibaba investment in Farfetch underscores how Alibaba has been able to circumvent some of the issues that luxury brands have with Amazon. Its Tmall Luxury Pavilion has successfully lured almost 200 high-end names onto its site by promising a highly burnished and controlled customer experience and a clampdown on counterfeit products.</p>\n<p>It also comes after new restrictions on international travel, which means that Chinese consumers \u2014 the consulting firm McKinsey & Company predicts they will account for $178 billion in luxury spending by 2025 \u2014 who used to splurge on luxury purchases abroad are now buying them at home. Alibaba and Richemont will put $300 million each into Farfetch itself and another $250 million each into a new joint venture called Farfetch China. They will own 25 percent of the Chinese entity and have an option to buy another 24 percent in about three years.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think this deal transcends competitors\u2019 offerings: You are either a disrupter or you are a disrupted, and I hate being the latter,\u201d Mr. Rupert said. \u201cBeing an owner of brands, this could have all dragged on, but we see this deal as an acceptance of a new way of retail. Even the whole of the luxury goods industry combined would still have difficulty fighting a giant like Amazon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Richemont is in a somewhat unorthodox position in that it also owns Yoox Net-a-Porter, once deemed Farfetch\u2019s biggest rival. Its online business continues to operate at a loss, and Yoox, which has lost most of its white-label clients, has proved an expensive asset. Three years ago, before the Yoox merger, Net-a-Porter\u2019s founders passed on merging with Farfetch. Now that Richemont (alongside Kering) appears to be hedging its bets, speculation has grown around the possible creation of a luxury e-commerce group with critical mass and ties to both the conglomerates and Asia.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to offer a reminder that we are open to every single group or brand,\u201d Mr. Neves, who was sitting in the audience for Mr. Rupert\u2019s speech in 2015, said in an interview. \u201cBrands and retailers are not our competitors, they are our partners. We are witnessing a paradigm shift in the way people buy luxury as more and more consumers gravitate online. We help clients become a part of that.\u201d</p>\n<p>There are still hurdles. A joint venture with Alibaba could potentially cannibalize Farfetch\u2019s existing operations. A previous, much-hyped Farfetch venture in China with JD.com failed to generate any momentum with consumers. Additionally, many luxury brands still yearn to consolidate and control the digital channels that connect them to consumers wherever they are in the world \u2014 with no third party involved.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u201dm not sure it will be a winner-take-all situation,\u201d said Antonio Achille, global head of luxury for McKinsey. \u201cBut there is no doubt Amazon will enter the game, or that there will be further consolidation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Some executive shuffling suggests that luxury companies are readying themselves for this new era. On Monday, Yoox Net-a-Porter announced that Geoffroy Lefebvre, currently group digital distribution director at Richemont, would become its chief executive in January. Meanwhile, Matchesfashion.com said it had poached Yoox Net-a-Porter\u2019s global buying director, Elizabeth von der Goltz, for the newly created role of chief commercial officer. And LVMH\u2019s digital chief, Ian Rogers, confirmed that he was leaving to join a French cryptocurrency start-up called Ledger.</p>\n<p>Last week, the German luxury e-commerce start up Mytheresa, formerly part of Neiman Marcus, said it had filed for an initial public offering in the U.S. in order to take advantage of the boom in online sales.</p>\n<p>Mr. Galloway says that for the players the calculation is simple.</p>\n<p>\u201cLuxury is struggling with the fact e-commerce is basically becoming Amazon in the West and Alibaba in the East,\u201d he said, before making an analogy to World War II. \u201cNone of them can fight the Germans on their own, so they need to ally with the Russians, which in this case is Alibaba. This is like the Russians and the British and the Americans getting together. They are competitors. The real enemy, however, is in Seattle.\u201d</p>"

(Isolation refers to people who are ill; quarantine refers to people who have been exposed to the virus and may become ill.)</p>\n<p>Setting the isolation period at five days is likely to be much more palatable and may encourage more infected people to comply, said Dr. Muge Cevik, an infectious disease expert at the University of St Andrews in Scotland who led the new analysis, published in the journal The Lancet Microbe.</p>\n<p>A recent survey in the United Kingdom showed that only one in five people were able to isolate for 10 days after developing symptoms. \u201cEven if we do more testing, if we can\u2019t ensure people self-isolate, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be able to control the spread,\u201d Dr. Cevik said.</p>\n<p>In the United States, many people don\u2019t get tested for the infection until a day or two after they begin to feel ill. With the current delays, many receive results two or three days later, toward the end of the period during which they are infectious.</p>\n<p>\u201cEven if you were to get the P.C.R. test right on the very first day that you could, by the time you get the results back, 90 percent of your shedding has been completed,\u201d said Dr. Michael Mina, a virologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \u201cThis meta-analysis shows just how short your transmission window is.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dr. Cevik and her colleagues set out to analyze the so-called kinetics of the coronavirus over the course of an infection, and to compare the pathogen to the closely related SARS and MERS viruses.</p>\n<p>The researchers considered nearly 1,500 studies published from 2003 to June 2020 on the timing of infection in thousands of people, most of whom were sick enough to be hospitalized. The team drew data from 79 studies of the new coronavirus, 11 studies of MERS and eight studies of SARS.</p>\n<p>People who never develop symptoms seem to carry about the same amount of the new coronavirus as symptomatic patients, Dr. Cevik and her colleagues found. But asymptomatic people seem to clear the virus more quickly from their bodies.</p>\n<p>People with Covid-19 usually are most infectious a day or two before the onset of symptoms until about five days after, the analysis concluded. Yet patients may carry genetic fragments from the virus in their noses and throats for an average of 17 days, and, in some cases, for up to three months.</p>\n<p>A few patients may carry infectious virus in their lungs \u2014 as opposed to the nose and throat \u2014 for as long as eight days after symptoms begin, noted Dr. Megan Ranney, an emergency physician at Brown University. For these patients, at least, isolation periods should probably be longer than five days, if only they could be identified.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe trouble is, who has Covid pneumonia versus who doesn\u2019t is not always fully apparent just based on physical exam,\u201d she said. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t know it on their own.\u201d</p>\n<p>Older people tend to be infectious for longer than younger people, but no study in the analysis detected live virus beyond nine days of symptom onset. The results suggest that positive tests after that point find only genetic fragments, rather than whole live virus, Dr. Cevik said.</p>\n<p>Because the infectious period seems to peak relatively quickly in the course of the illness, health care workers at community clinics may be at higher risk of becoming infected than those working in I.C.U. units, where patients tend to be in the later stages, Dr. Cevik added.</p>\n<p>The analysis underscores data that has accumulated since March. In July, based on similar evidence, the C.D.C. truncated its recommendation for isolation to 10 days from 14 days.</p>\n<p>But even at 10 days, the isolation period may be too long for many people, experts said. Patients may be financially unable to isolate for so long, or they may not feel sick enough to want to do so.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you could make that shorter for people, I think that would really help people comply with the public health guidelines,\u201d said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist affiliated with the Center for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University, referring to the recommended isolation period.</p>\n<p>But the new analysis is limited by the fact that only a few of the included studies looked at live virus, she added.</p>\n<p>Some people who are older or very sick may be infectious for longer than a week. But if a shorter recommended period encourages more people to isolate, the benefit will more than offset any risk to the community from the small amount of virus that a few patients may still carry after five days, said Dr. Stefan Baral, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University.</p>\n<h3>The Coronavirus Outbreak \u203a</h3>\n<h4>Words to Know About Testing</h4>\n<p>Confused by the terms about coronavirus testing? Let us help:</p>\n<p>But some doctors said that they were not convinced by the analysis that five days of isolation would prevent transmission from a majority of people.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a sweet spot there, I would imagine, but I haven\u2019t figured out where that is,\u201d said Dr. Taison Bell, a critical care and infectious disease physician at the University of Virginia.</p>\n<p>Dr. Cevik and other experts suggest that people can isolate as soon as they experience even mild symptoms, such as a sore throat or head and body aches \u2014 without venturing out for a P.C.R. test right when they are most infectious.</p>\n<p>But Dr. Bell said he was unsure how this would work in practice, because these early symptoms were similar to those from other viral infections, including the common cold.</p>\n<p>Dr. Cevik said a P.C.R. test could be performed after isolation ended to confirm the diagnosis. Alternately, it may make sense to take a rapid antigen test \u2014 which can detect high amounts of virus \u2014 while isolating, so as to confirm an active coronavirus infection.</p>\n<p>Other experts also endorsed the use of at-home rapid tests. \u201cI think that\u2019s a lovely solution,\u201d Dr. Ranney said. \u201cIf you have symptoms, and you have a reliable test that you can do at home, stay home, test at home and isolate for five days.\u201d</p>\n<p>Over all, the new analysis underscores how quickly the coronavirus blooms in the body and the speed with which both patients and doctors must respond to keep it contained, Dr. Baral said. Levels of the MERS virus peak at seven to 10 days from symptom onset, and those of the SARS virus peak at Days 10 to 14.</p>\n<p>By contrast, the new coronavirus \u201cmoves quick,\u201d Dr. Baral said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult virus to control, as compared to SARS.\u201d</p>\n<p>Home isolation is safe for most of those newly infected with the coronavirus, he added \u2014 essentially the model of care that doctors use for patients suspected of having influenza.</p>\n<p>Some countries already have adopted policies to make it easier for people to isolate. Vietnam provides income support to people who need to take time off work. Until May, the Japanese government asked patients who were young and had mild symptoms to stay home for four days before seeking testing.</p>\n<p>Japan\u2019s guidelines now ask patients to consult by phone with their doctors and to seek testing only if they seem likely to be infected. Anyone who tests positive is admitted to a hospital or a hotel to isolate. In the United States, New York City and Vermont have made similar accommodations available to infected patients.</p>\n<p>Even if the rest of the country doesn\u2019t implement such policies, having patients isolate at home \u2014 while wearing a mask, keeping windows open, cleaning high-touch surfaces and staying far from other household members \u2014 is more feasible for five days than for 10, Dr. Baral said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do think there\u2019s an element of diminishing returns with those last four or five days,\u201d he said. \u201cAn intense amount of isolation during that first five to seven days would avert a ton of infections \u2014 a ton.\u201d</p>\n<p>Makiko Inoue contributed reporting from Tokyo.</p>"

                "headline": "Why School Districts Are Bringing Back Younger Children First",
                "subheadline": "New York City became the highest-profile example when Mayor de Blasio said elementary schools would reopen starting Dec. 7.",
                "byline": "By Eliza Shapiro and Kate Taylor",
                "body": "<p>After a summer of uncertainty and fear about how schools across the globe would operate in a pandemic, a consensus has emerged in more and more districts: In-person teaching with young children is safer than with older ones and particularly crucial for their development.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, New York City, home to the country\u2019s largest school system, became the most high-profile example of that trend, when Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that only pre-Ks, elementary schools and some schools for children with complex disabilities would reopen next week after all city classrooms were briefly shut in November. There is currently no plan to bring middle and high school students back into city school buildings.</p>\n<p>It was an abrupt about-face for the mayor, who had for months promised to welcome all the city\u2019s 1.1 million children \u2014 from 3-year-olds to high school seniors \u2014 back into classrooms this fall.</p>\n<p>But the decision put New York in line with other cities in America and across the world that have reopened classrooms first, and often exclusively, for young children, and in some cases kept them open even as those cities have confronted second waves of the virus.</p>\n<p>In-person learning is essential for young children, who often need intensive parental supervision just to log on for the day, education experts say. And mounting evidence has shown that elementary schools are unlikely to fuel transmission as long as districts adopt strict safety measures. The evidence is more mixed for middle and high schools.</p>\n<p>\u201cWith younger kids, we see this pleasant confluence of two facts: Science tells us that younger children are less likely to contract, and seemingly less likely to transmit, the virus,\u201d said Elliot Haspel, the author of \u201cCrawling Behind: America\u2019s Child Care Crisis and How to Fix It.\u201d</p>\n<p>He added: \u201cAnd younger children are the ones that most need in-person schooling, and in-person interactions.\u201d</p>\n<p>Districts including Chicago, Philadelphia and Los Angeles have plans to bring back young children first when they eventually reopen classrooms.</p>\n<p>In Rhode Island, Gov. Gina Raimondo, a strong proponent of keeping schools open, recently asked colleges to shift to all-remote learning after Thanksgiving and gave districts the option of reducing the number of high school students attending in person. She said there was \u201cnot a shred of data to suggest schools are major spreaders,\u201d but said that high schools had proved to be more problematic than elementary and middle schools, because the students are more mobile.</p>\n<p>That model of giving priority to younger students has been pioneered in Europe, where many countries have kept primary schools open even as most other parts of public life have closed during the continent\u2019s second wave.</p>\n<p>Italy has kept its primary schools open but left middle and high schools remote-only, and while all schools in Germany are open, discussions about possible closures have focused mainly on high schools.</p>\n<p>In America, more and more districts have begun to prioritize elementary school students for in-person learning.</p>\n<p>In urban districts, which generally have been slower to reopen than rural and suburban districts, that has meant making plans to bring back the youngest students first. In parts of the Midwest where school districts were more aggressive about reopening, and where there has been a huge rise in cases, public health officials have emphasized keeping elementary schools open even as they have closed high schools and in some cases middle schools.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe data is becoming more compelling that there is very limited transmission in day care and grade schools,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota and a member of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s coronavirus task force, in a recent interview.</p>\n<p>\u201cI keep telling people, \u2018Stop talking about kids \u2014 talk about those younger than 10,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a very different epidemiology in that group than we\u2019re seeing, for example, in high school students.\u201d</p>\n<p>The data is far from perfect, but several studies have suggested that children under 10 transmit the virus less efficiently than older children or adults.</p>\n<p>A study published in the journal Pediatrics surveyed 57,000 child care providers across the United States and found that those who continued working during the first three months of the pandemic were not any more likely to get sick than those whose programs closed.</p>\n<p>That evidence has allowed experts to focus on urgent concerns about how young children are actually learning during the pandemic. Mr. Haspel and others have raised urgent concerns about children\u2019s ability to learn how to read over an iPad or laptop screen.</p>\n<p>When teachers attempt to teach reading remotely, \u201cyou are really kind of tying one leg to the other and trying to run a race,\u201d he said, in part because young children often need small group or individual instruction.</p>\n<p>Every aspect of remote learning, from signing in to completing assignments, requires basic literacy. That is why so many parents and caretakers have had to sacrifice work or bring their children to day care centers so that the children can get full-time help completing tasks online.</p>\n<p>Abundant evidence has shown that students who are not reading by third grade have an extremely hard time catching up with their peers who do and are more likely to drop out of high school.</p>\n<p>Crucially, reopening elementary schools \u2014 while keeping middle and high schools closed \u2014 has become the favored option of influential teachers\u2019 unions, whose leaders have pushed to delay reopening plans in some cities because of lack of federal funding, insufficient safety measures and an outpouring of concern from rank-and-file educators about returning to classrooms.</p>\n<p>But Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, the nation\u2019s second largest teachers\u2019 union, said New York\u2019s plan to bring back elementary school students with stringent safety protocols could be a national model.</p>\n<h3>Schools During Coronavirus \u203a</h3>\n<h4>Back to School</h4>\n<p>Updated Nov. 27, 2020</p>\n<p>The latest on how the pandemic is reshaping education.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat we\u2019ve learned is that, unlike adults, elementary school students actually follow the rules, and actually have been really good at wearing their masks and adhering to physical distancing, and are really grateful about having school,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact that young kids follow the rules and pedagogically need in-person education is a good news story.\u201d</p>\n<p>When New York announced its new reopening plan, Ms. Weingarten offered her clear endorsement, and a supportive statement from the United Federation of Teachers, New York City\u2019s teachers\u2019 union, quickly followed.</p>\n<p>Asked why his administration was turning its focus to young children, Mr. de Blasio said Sunday, \u201cI feel for all our parents who are experiencing so many challenges right now, how important it is for them to have their younger kids in school, how important that is at that age, both educationally and socially.\u201d</p>\n<p>Some New York City schools are reopening despite rising cases here. But other districts, including Chicago, Los Angeles and Philadelphia, have pledged to reopen schools, starting with young children, only when \u2014 or if \u2014 virus cases stabilize.</p>\n<p>Officials in Las Vegas and its surrounding suburbs had hoped to restart in-person learning in November. Then came a steep rise in cases that forced the district to delay its plan until at least February.</p>\n<p>But the school superintendent, Jesus Jara, said he is intent on bringing as many students back as possible, in part because of the catastrophic toll of remote learning on children\u2019s mental health: There have already been 12 student suicides this academic year in the district, Dr. Jara said.</p>\n<p>Young children will restart in-person classes first when classrooms reopen.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat has been our biggest concern, that our babies have been home without face-to-face instruction for so long,\u201d Dr. Jara said.</p>\n<p>A few districts have prioritized the youngest children from the beginning.</p>\n<p>In Massachusetts, the Cambridge public school district has brought back students in preschool and children in prekindergarten through first grade, along with some students in all grades who have disabilities or are learning English.</p>\n<p>Some districts that opened earlier in the fall for all grades \u2014 and have seen cases rise sharply \u2014 have chosen to move high schools, and in some cases middle schools, to remote learning but to keep elementary schools open.</p>\n<p>On Nov. 15, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, a Democrat, issued an emergency order shutting down indoor service at bars and restaurants, closing casinos and movie theaters, halting most organized sports and forcing high schools and colleges to transition to remote learning.</p>\n<p>But the state kept open elementary and middle schools, saying that younger students needed in-person learning the most and that there had been fewer outbreaks associated with elementary and middle schools than with high schools and colleges.</p>\n<p>And in Johnson County, Kan., a suburb of Kansas City where cases are surging, school districts have switched middle and high school to remote learning while keeping in-person classes for elementary schools.</p>\n<p>But in some parts of the country, politicians and education officials have resisted calls to close high schools even as the virus ravaged their communities throughout the fall. President Trump has continued to insist that schools should remain open, even though school leaders across the country have said they need more federal stimulus dollars to reopen safely.</p>\n<p>Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, a Republican, has been one of the most vocal proponents of school reopening. On Monday, he said officials who sought to close schools were akin to \u201ctoday\u2019s flat-earthers.\u201d</p>\n<p>Reported was contributed by Jennifer Medina in Los Angeles, Neil MacFarquhar in New York, Melissa Eddy in Berlin and Raphael Minder in Barcelona.</p>"

                "byline": "By Eliza Shapiro",
                "body": "<p>Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Sunday that he would reopen public elementary schools, abruptly shifting policy in the face of widespread criticism that officials were placing more of a priority on economic activities like indoor dining than the well-being of New York City\u2019s children.</p>\n<p>Mr. de Blasio said middle and high schools would remain closed, but also signaled that he would overhaul how the city manages the system during the pandemic, which has forced millions of children in the United States out of schools and is perceived to have done significant damage to their education and mental health. </p>\n<p>The mayor said the city would abandon a 3 percent test positivity threshold that it had adopted for closing the school system, the largest in the country, with 1.1 million children. And he said the system would aim to give many parents the option of sending their children to school five days a week, which would effectively end the so-called hybrid learning system for some city schools. </p>\n<p>Students can return only if they have already signed up for in-person learning, meaning just about 190,000 children in the grades and schools the city is reopening next week would be eligible. About 335,000 students in total have chosen in-person classes. </p>\n<p>Children in pre-K and elementary school can return starting Dec. 7. Mr. de Blasio also announced that students with the most complex disabilities can return on Dec. 10. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever happens ahead, we want this to be the plan going forward,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said at a news conference. \u201cWe know what we didn\u2019t know over the summer, we know what works from actual experience.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. de Blasio is reopening elementary schools even though the city\u2019s seven-day average test positivity rate on Sunday had climbed to 3.9 percent \u2014 well above the former threshold that led him to close the system on Nov. 18 as a second wave of the outbreak threatened the city.</p>\n<p>Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who has often clashed with Mr. de Blasio over the response to the pandemic and has final authority over how schools operate during the crisis, said on Sunday that he supported the mayor\u2019s plan. </p>\n<p>Bringing children and educators safely back into public schools has been one of the most vexing, high-stakes problems created by the pandemic. </p>\n<p>As virus cases have spiked across the country in recent weeks, some cities, like Philadelphia, have delayed plans to reopen schools, and others, including Los Angeles, do not yet have a plan to reopen. Many children throughout the country have not returned to classrooms since March, and it is unclear how many will before a vaccine is distributed.</p>\n<p>Starting in the summer, Mr. de Blasio sought to make New York the first big city in the country to fully reopen its public school system. After a series of logistical and political problems forced the mayor to twice delay the start of in-person classes, the city welcomed hundreds of thousands of children back into classrooms about two months ago. </p>\n<p>Reopening, despite its many issues, was a major milestone in the city\u2019s long path to recovery \u2014 and the closing of the schools less than eight weeks later was a blow.</p>\n<p>Still, the number of cases in the school system itself remained very low, so Mr. de Blasio\u2019s decision became a flash point in a broader debate throughout the country and the world over what should be closed during the pandemic. Officials have wrestled with whether to keep classrooms open while forcing indoor dining rooms and bars, which are far more likely to spread the virus, to shut. </p>\n<p>Mr. Cuomo, not the mayor, controls regulations regarding indoor dining, bars and gyms. But after the city schools closed, both Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio had come under intense criticism from some parents, who expressed deep concern about how their children were faring during remote learning.</p>\n<p>In fact, the timing of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s announcement raised new questions about why he decided to close schools at all just 12 days ago. </p>\n<p>Managing the city\u2019s sprawling public school system has clearly been one of the most daunting tasks facing the mayor and his team during the pandemic. But the seemingly haphazard changes to the reopening plan have been frustrating for parents and educators. The mayor himself acknowledged as much on Sunday when asked whether he had any regrets about closing schools again.</p>\n<p>\u201cI felt pained \u2014 I didn\u2019t want to do that to kids or parents,\u201d he said. </p>\n<p>After several tumultuous weeks, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s announcement was generally well-received on Sunday. The powerful teachers union, the United Federation of Teachers, which has often clashed with City Hall over its effort to reopen the system, said it supported the new plan, as long as rigorous virus testing was in place.</p>\n<p>The new blueprint represents the city\u2019s second shot at reopening, after the first attempt was plagued by problems and the trigger that Mr. de Blasio\u2019 set for closing schools \u2014 a positive rate of 3 percent on all virus tests conducted in the city \u2014 was roundly assailed as too low by parents, politicians and public health experts. </p>\n<p>Now, instead of using such a metric, the city will increase testing in schools and close those that have multiple confirmed virus cases. The system will also, for now, adopt a model that has become more common across the country and world, offering classroom instruction only to young children and students with disabilities. </p>\n<p>Since Mr. de Blasio first announced his plan to reopen schools in July, mounting evidence has shown that elementary schools in particular can be relatively safe, as long as strict safety protocols are followed. </p>\n<p>New York\u2019s schools had extremely low test positivity rates during the roughly eight weeks they were open this fall, and there was agreement from the president of the teachers\u2019 union to the mayor\u2019s top public health officials that schools were far safer than had been anticipated. By the time schools closed, the school positivity rate was .28 percent. </p>\n<p>When elementary schools reopen, the city will significantly increase random testing: Rather than testing a sampling of students and staff in each building once a month, the city will test weekly. Students will not be allowed to attend in person unless parents sign consent forms, allowing testing. </p>\n<p>Nothing else about New York City\u2019s safety plan will change; six feet of social distance will be mandated. But the city will reduce its use of hybrid learning \u2014 under which children physically attended school a few days a week and learned remotely the rest of the time \u2014 for many schools. </p>\n<h3>Schools During Coronavirus \u203a</h3>\n<h4>Back to School</h4>\n<p>Updated Nov. 27, 2020</p>\n<p>The latest on how the pandemic is reshaping education.</p>\n<p>Some schools that have seen large numbers of students return to classrooms will most likely have to stick with hybrid for the time being. </p>\n<p>But many schools, particularly in neighborhoods with large populations of Black, Latino and Asian-American students, have had low enrollment. Some teachers reported seeing just three or four students a day, though most classrooms can hold about nine children under pandemic rules.</p>\n<p>It is likely that in those neighborhoods, more children will be able to return full time. </p>\n<p>The hybrid learning plan was undercut from the start by a series of regulations about who could teach and when, which had been agreed upon by the teachers\u2019 union and City Hall.</p>\n<p>Teachers could not be required to teach both in-person and online on the same day and were discouraged from livestreaming lessons in the classroom to children at home, even though other districts have adopted that practice. </p>\n<p>Many educators said the rules were nearly impossible to follow, and some schools disregarded them. Some large high schools urged students to stay remote full time, so that schools could more easily offer electives and advanced courses. As a result, in-person high school enrollment has been relatively low. </p>\n<p>Parents said that children were delighted to be back in classrooms, but that the quality of education provided under the hybrid plan was sometimes lacking.</p>\n<p>Students chose in-person learning at far lower rates than Mr. de Blasio had hoped and expected. After predicting over the summer that about 75 percent of the school system would return for classroom instruction, the city recently revealed that just under a third of students actually did. </p>\n<p>The percentage of students who can return to classrooms in the coming days will certainly be lower than that, since middle and high school students who opted for in-person classes will not have that option for now. </p>\n<p>City data has shown that white families, who make up just 15 percent of the public school system, have chosen all-remote learning at the lowest rates. </p>\n<p>That means that white students may have a disproportionate presence in city classrooms once they are reopened, and can attend school full time, while hundreds of thousands of children of color may be learning from home until next fall. </p>\n<p>Asked about that dynamic on Sunday, Mr. de Blasio said he was \u201cvery concerned,\u201d but said school would return to normal after a vaccine was distributed. </p>\n<p>The mayor said earlier this fall that families would not have another opportunity to switch from remote to in-person classes. </p>\n<p>That is sure to upset some parents who might have chosen in-person learning if they had known that their children might have been able to return to school full time \u2014 and will present a frustrating challenge for principals, who will once again be forced to restructure their schools.</p>\n<p>Remote learning has been particularly disastrous for the roughly 24,000 children in New York\u2019s District 75, a set of schools for children with disabilities who require the most intensive support, which includes students on the autism spectrum and children with serious cognitive delays. </p>\n<p>Online learning simply was not an option, and their parents have spent months asking the city to get their children back into classrooms as often as possible. </p>"

Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, both conservative Republicans, whom he has accused of not doing enough to help him overturn the result.</p>\n<p>Over the weekend, he escalated his attacks on Mr. Kemp, saying he was \u201cashamed\u201d to have endorsed him in 2018, and on Monday he called Mr. Kemp \u201chapless\u201d as he urged him to \u201coverrule his obstinate Republican Secretary of state.\u2019'</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump\u2019s broadsides have quietly rattled some Republicans in the state, who fear that concerns about the fairness of the presidential election could depress turnout for the Senate races, which will determine whether Democrats or Republicans control the chamber.</p>\n<p>After resisting entreaties to appear in Georgia, the president plans to travel there this weekend, though even some of his own aides remain uncertain whether his anger toward state officials will overshadow any support he may lend the party\u2019s two candidates.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t say the system is rigged but elect these two senators,\u201d said Eric Johnson, a campaign adviser to Kelly Loeffler, one of the G.O.P. Senate candidates, and a former Republican leader of the Georgia Senate. \u201cAt some point he either drops it or he says I want everybody to vote and get their friends to vote so that the margins are so large that they can\u2019t steal it.\u201d</p>\n<p>The split signifies both an extraordinary dispute over election integrity within the Republican Party and a preview of the control the president may continue to exert over the conservative base even after he leaves office. As Mr. Trump talks seriously about the possibility of mounting another bid for the White House in 2024, his personal goals may not always align with those of his party \u2014 no matter the political stakes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI had someone message me just last week saying: \u2018Nope, I\u2019m done. Can\u2019t trust the election. Never voting again,\u2019\u201d said Buzz Brockway, a former Republican state representative. \u201cThe president has a very dedicated group of supporters who don\u2019t really support the broader Republican Party \u2014 they support him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump, who earned about 12,700 fewer votes than Joseph R. Biden Jr. in Georgia, has requested a machine recount, which is underway. A hand recount of all five million ballots found a few thousand uncounted ballots that slightly reduced Mr. Biden\u2019s lead.</p>\n<p>Already, a handful of Trump allies, citing fears of fraud, are urging supporters to boycott the Senate elections or write in the president\u2019s name \u2014 an option not provided on the Georgia ballot in runoffs.</p>\n<p>L. Lin Wood, a conservative Georgia lawyer and a Trump ally, is advising conservatives not to vote in the runoff elections, tweeting on Sunday that he won\u2019t vote in \u201canother fraudulent election with rigged voting machines & fake mail ballots.\u201d Mr. Wood sued unsuccessfully to stop the state\u2019s election certification and is now appealing for an injunction to stop the Jan. 5 runoff contests.</p>\n<p>While that remains a fringe position, some Republican strategists and officials worry that the argument for not voting could gain traction if the president continues his attacks.</p>\n<p>In Marietta, Ga., this weekend, Republican voters questioned Ronna McDaniel, the national party chairwoman, about why they should invest \u201cmoney and time\u201d in a runoff election that some see as already rigged against them.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not decided. This is the key \u2014 it\u2019s not decided,\u201d she pleaded with the audience. \u201cIf you lose your faith and you don\u2019t vote and people walk away, that will decide it. We have to work hard.\u201d</p>\n<p>Many top G.O.P. officials, including the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, have not commented on Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on Georgia\u2019s electoral system. But his vitriol has roiled Republican politics in the state, where Mr. Biden upended several decades of G.O.P. dominance with a surprising victory over the president.</p>\n<p>Historically, runoff contests have favored Republicans because of a drop-off of Democratic voters after the general election. But given the demographic changes in the state and concentrated efforts by Democrats to register more of their voters \u2014 and persuade them to cast absentee ballots before Election Day \u2014 many Republicans are preparing for a far tighter contest.</p>\n<p>Parties, activists and allied outside groups have poured money and manpower into the state, investing heavily in advertising and grass-roots efforts.</p>\n<p>Aware of Mr. Trump\u2019s popularity with conservative voters, both Ms. Loeffler and David Perdue, the other G.O.P. senator seeking a new term, have bolstered Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion on Twitter that the 2020 election was a \u201ctotal scam,\u201d and called for Mr. Raffensperger to resign. Mr. Kemp, who was elected governor with the president\u2019s backing and is already raising money for his re-election bid in 2022, is wary of angering Mr. Trump while still trying to support the state officials who conducted a free and fair election.</p>\n<p>On Monday, Mr. Kemp\u2019s office released a statement noting that Georgia law prohibits the governor from interfering in elections, disputing Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that he could override decisions by the secretary of state with an executive order.</p>\n<p>Mr. Kemp\u2019s campaign for governor, meanwhile, sent an email to supporters emphasizing his support for continuing \u201cinvestigations into ALL voting irregularities\u2019\u2019 \u2014 a reflection of how important it is to appeal to Mr. Trump\u2019s loyal base.</p>\n<p>Mr. Raffensperger, who as Georgia\u2019s top election official has borne the brunt of Trump supporters\u2019 attacks, pushed back on Monday against the baseless conspiracy theories being floated by the president and his allies, in particular that software used by the state was manipulated by foreign oligarchs.</p>\n<p>Like Mr. Kemp, Mr. Raffensperger is in a precarious position; even as he refuses to take steps to override the will of Georgia voters, he is also seeking to convince Republicans that he will be aggressive in ferreting out claims of liberal fraud.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are those who are exploiting the emotions of many Trump supporters with fantastic claims,\u201d he said at a news conference on Monday morning. \u201cHalf-truths, misinformation, and frankly, they\u2019re misleading the president as well, apparently.\u201d</p>\n<p>He also announced that his office was beginning investigations into four get-out-the-vote groups, including the New Georgia Project, which was founded by Stacey Abrams, Mr. Kemp\u2019s 2018 rival in the governor\u2019s race and the de facto leader of the Georgia Democrats. Mr. Raffensperger said that the groups were \u201cworking to register people in other states to vote here in Georgia.\u201d</p>\n<p>Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker from Georgia and a Trump supporter, said that the dissatisfaction with Mr. Kemp and Mr. Raffensperger was so widespread among Republican activists that he anticipated primary challenges against both men two years from now.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve had very close friends write me and say, \u2018I have a Republican governor and secretary of state, and they\u2019re both useless, so why do I stay involved?\u2019\u201d Mr. Gingrich said. \u201cBut I think they\u2019ll take pretty active measures to get people to turn out based on the long-term historical importance of these two seats.\u201d</p>\n<p>Some Republicans are striving to persuade Trump supporters to again engage with that very system the president is denigrating. Surrogates, including Vice President Mike Pence, have already campaigned in Georgia. Other Trump allies are forming a super PAC that will broadcast ads featuring Donald Trump Jr., a popular figure in right-wing circles, urging their supporters to vote in the runoff elections.</p>\n<p>So far, the president himself has spent little time focused on the Senate races, and instead has been far more focused on his desire for a recount of his own loss. But advisers have stressed to him that a Republican Senate is important, and as Mr. Pence was also traveling to Georgia on Saturday, Mr. Trump agreed to go as well.</p>\n<p>Republicans inside and outside of Mr. Trump\u2019s camp are divided as to whether an appearance will be productive. Some think it will help, since the party\u2019s base voters will respond to him. Top Republicans have encouraged him to make the trip. But some of the president\u2019s advisers are concerned about exactly how off-script he might go, and whether he will spend most of his speech attacking Mr. Kemp and other Republicans.</p>\n<p>\u201cI would hope when the president is in Georgia Saturday, he talks about the importance of turning out the vote,\u201d Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, said Monday. \u201cAnd I think what he says on that trip will probably matter more than what he has said up until now.\u201d</p>\n<p>The president\u2019s attacks on Georgia\u2019s voting system are part of his overall efforts to undermine the electoral system, as a way of rationalizing his defeat. He has directed his anger at other states, and governors, as he did Monday with Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona.</p>\n<p>But unlike in other states, where down-ballot races are largely decided, Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric in Georgia could carry long-term political consequences for both parties. If Republicans hold only one of the two seats, they will keep the Senate majority, giving them an effective veto over Mr. Biden\u2019s agenda.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs legal options are exhausted, conservatives will move on to the next fight,\u201d said Brad Todd, a Republican strategist. \u201cMore than likely watching Nancy Pelosi be sworn in and seeing the scaffolding on the west front of the Capitol preparing for an inauguration is going to cause a unity of purpose among conservatives.\u201d</p>\n<p>James Sublett, 67, voted for Mr. Trump this year and believes the president\u2019s unfounded claims that Democrats \u201cstole the election.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Democrats have cheated, they have dead people vote, they manufactured votes,\u201d said Mr. Sublett, a retired real estate broker.</p>\n<p>Still, he said it was important to vote in the Georgia runoffs.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t get those Republican seats, this country is turning into socialism and communism 101,\u201d Mr. Sublett said.</p>\n<p>Isabella Grull\u00f3n Paz and Nicholas Fandos contributed reporting.</p>"

                "subheadline": "Inequalities are especially pronounced in English youth soccer, where only a handful of clubs have kept training open for future female professionals, while boys at the same level play on.",
                "byline": "By Anna Schaverien",
                "body": "<p>When Lisa Bloor heard that her daughter Abby\u2019s elite-level soccer club was being shut down in England\u2019s latest coronavirus lockdown she faced a tough problem: how to explain that boys at the same level were allowed to keep playing.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do I tell my daughter it\u2019s because she\u2019s a girl?\u201d Ms. Bloor asked. \u201cIt\u2019s disheartening. There\u2019s no logic in it at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>As the coronavirus has upended lives across the world, women have found themselves disproportionately affected, whether by taking on the often invisible labor of an outsize share in household duties, caring for children and relatives or finding the hard-fought gains they made in the workplace in past years almost entirely wiped out.</p>\n<p>In early November, after Britain\u2019s government reluctantly admitted the need for a second lockdown of all but England\u2019s most essential services to stop the number of Covid-19 cases spiraling out of control, the restrictions \u2014 and exceptions to the rules \u2014 laid bare yet another gender gap: the one between women and men\u2019s sports.</p>\n<p>When the British government granted \u201celite sport\u201d special dispensations for the duration of a four-week lockdown, the top six tiers of men\u2019s soccer could carry on training and competing. But only the top two women\u2019s soccer leagues were permitted to continue.</p>\n<p>The Football Association, which governs the sport in England, ruled that the men\u2019s F.A. Cup tournament would not stop, but postponed the women\u2019s F.A. Cup until the national lockdown lifts in early December.</p>\n<p>Nowhere was the gender divide more transparent than in the decision surrounding the soccer clubs\u2019 academies, which sharpen the skills of the most promising school-age players and prepare them to turn professional.</p>\n<p>Boys\u2019 training at more than 80 English Football League and Premier League clubs\u2019 academies could remain open under \u201celite\u201d protocols, but the F.A. decided that girls\u2019 academies at clubs such as Everton \u2014 where Abby Clarke, Ms. Bloor\u2019s 16-year-old daughter, trains at least four times a week as part of the development squad \u2014 were \u201cnonelite\u201d and would have to suspend all activity throughout the lockdown.</p>\n<p>The governing body later rowed back that decision, but admitted it was likely that only a few girls\u2019 academies \u2014 four or five at the most \u2014 would reopen, because of a dearth of resources. To adhere to the \u201celite\u201d protocols, clubs must complete thorough risk assessments and have a range of medical staff on hand to oversee rigorous testing \u2014 a steep cost when budgets in women\u2019s soccer are small and already stretched.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t argue with the ambition to have fairness and parity,\u201d said Kelly Simmons, the F.A.\u2019s director of the women\u2019s professional game. \u201cIt comes down to where the women\u2019s game is in terms of its resources and its commercial revenue at the moment. The men\u2019s game has been able to invest multimillions into boys\u2019 academies and state of the art facilities. We\u2019re not there yet on the women and girls\u2019 side.\u201d</p>\n<p>Halfway through lockdown, after two weeks of her daughter\u2019s training alone and kicking a ball against a wall, Ms. Bloor that said Everton reversed field and decided it could afford to restart girls\u2019 training. But she was dismayed that many other girls were not as fortunate.</p>\n<p>Other soccer-mad girls took to social media to ask #IsItBecauseIAmAGirl, railing against the F.A.\u2019s different rules for men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams as a petition calling for girls and women\u2019s soccer to continue reached more than 15,000 signatures within the space of a few days.</p>\n<p>Philip Gill, the father of three girls between 22 months and 12 years old, and the coach of a girls\u2019 soccer team in Padiham, in northwest England, started the appeal.</p>\n<p>Mr. Gill said the F.A.\u2019s decision \u201cputs on this perception that if you\u2019re a girl, you\u2019re less important. I don\u2019t want my kids growing up seeing that.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to give the ladies\u2019 game the same opportunities as they\u2019ve given the men\u2019s,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Soccer is far from the only sport where differences between the treatment of men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams have been accentuated by the coronavirus pandemic and lockdowns.</p>\n<p>As Britain emerged from its first lockdown, the men's international cricket team began play this summer months before the women\u2019s.</p>\n<p>A similar delay occurred in rugby union. But even after play resumed, the women\u2019s teams confronted new rules designed to limit transmission of the virus, while a costly testing system was provided for the men\u2019s teams so they could play by the same rules as before.</p>\n<p>In a recent study of the first lockdown, Britain\u2019s elite sportswomen reported that their finances and fitness had taken a sharper hit than those of their male counterparts. That\u2019s largely because, unlike the men, they are paid only on a match-fee basis and had to pay for fitness equipment during lockdown, while men could borrow from their clubs\u2019 gyms.</p>\n<p>\u201cLockdown definitely entrenched those ideas that women\u2019s sport aren\u2019t on the same level as men\u2019s sport in terms of opportunity, access and funding,\u201d said Ali Bowes, a senior lecturer in sociology of sport at Nottingham Trent University, who led the research.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not just professional sportswomen who have felt the effects of lockdowns on sports and exercise more acutely than men.</p>\n<p>Research from Sport England into the impact of the first lockdown found that women were more affected by care responsibilities, more anxious about leaving home to exercise and more affected by reductions in group activities.</p>\n<p>\u201cEverything\u2019s pointing to lockdown having made it worse for women,\u201d Dr. Bowes said.</p>\n<p>As part of the lockdown, gyms, public swimming pools, dance studios, tennis courts and other facilities were ordered to shut their doors. With those avenues closed, advocates for women\u2019s sports say that many women will be deterred from staying active over the winter because of safety concerns about exercising outdoors in the dark.</p>\n<p>Lucy Robinson, a 22-year-old student based in Derbyshire, is in exactly that position. She gave up running alone after one wintry evening last year when she was out jogging and a stranger followed her on a bike, shouting lewd comments.</p>\n<p>With gyms shut because of the lockdown, Ms. Robinson, who is not a fan of online classes, said she was missing out on the physical and mental health benefits that sport can bring.</p>\n<p>\u201cWomen are being put in a really tough situation where they have to choose between making their health worse or putting their safety at risk,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>For the women who do want to relieve cabin fever with a run outdoors, the government\u2019s coronavirus regulations have done little to assuage safety fears.</p>\n<p>Research from England Athletics has shown a third of women have been harassed while out running alone and that many would feel safer when running with a group. But group exercise is not permitted during the lockdown.</p>\n<p>The government devised an exception to the restrictions that allows for one person not in your household to join you for outdoors exercise, provided they keep a safe distance, but that has been criticized as impractical.</p>\n<p>Rini Jones, a marathon runner who shares her experiences on her Instagram account, abrowngirlruns, is still going out for runs alone during lockdown but always takes a number of precautions, including running only along well-lit roads.</p>\n<p>Sexual assault and the killings of female joggers, especially women of color, play on her mind, and Ms. Jones said that she usually considers the cars passing her by as potential witnesses should anything happen to her. </p>\n<p>\u201cThere is an inexcusable lack of understanding at the highest levels of decision-making that this is the reality for women, and for women of color and marginalized women, it\u2019s even more precarious,\u201d she said. </p>\n<p>For the women whose exercise and sporting lives have been jeopardized by the monthlong lockdown in England, there is a small light at the end of the tunnel: Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s government announced on Monday that when the country moves into a tiered system of restrictions in early December, sports teams will be allowed to reunite and gyms will be allowed to open their doors to customers again, though group exercise classes remain banned in some places.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a welcome relief for many, but Dr. Bowes, who led the research into the impact of lockdowns, said that she hoped that the new light that the coronavirus restrictions have shone on the deep-seated issues in how women\u2019s sports and exercise are treated could herald greater accountability for gender inequalities.</p>\n<p>The differences, she said, are \u201cthe byproduct of over 100 years of sport prioritizing men.\u201d But, \u201cin these extreme moments when the world goes upside down, we start to see where the priorities are,\u201d Dr. Bowes said. Speaking up and calling out the problems, she said, \u201csets us on a really positive path for how things might change in the future.\u201d</p>"

It\u2019s more like your kid lying on the floor of the living room doing halfhearted leg-lifts by the light of her laptop.</p>\n<p>Many students, particularly tweens and teens, are not moving their bodies as much as they are supposed to be \u2014 during a pandemic or otherwise. (60 minutes per day for ages 6 to 17, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.) A March 2020 report in The Lancet offers scientific evidence as to why your kids won\u2019t get off the couch: As children move through adolescence, they indeed become more sedentary, which is associated with greater risk of depression by the age of 18. Being physically active is important for their physical health as well as mental health.</p>\n<p>Yet with many organized team sports on hiatus and athletic fields, playgrounds and climbing gyms closed or restricted to smaller groups during shorter hours, what\u2019s an increasingly lazy child to do? More accurately: What\u2019s a mother or father of an increasingly lazy child to do?</p>\n<p>Many parents are taking charge, finding informal and creative ways to entice their isolated tweens and teens off their screens and outside \u2014 with others, safely. To get your own younger ones moving, here are a few ideas from families around the country, all almost-guaranteed hits, even with winter coming.</p>\n<p>A SENSE OF CAMARADERIE</p>\n<h2>Start a small running club.</h2>\n<p>In San Francisco, under rain, fog or blue skies (or even the infamous orange one), a group of sixth graders have been gathering in Golden Gate Park two times a week to run two miles. Their unofficial motto: \u201cSafe Distance, Minimal Distance.\u201d Masks are required and photo breaks are frequent, as is post-run ice cream. Started on a whim by local parents in late-August, the club has been such a hit, attracting anywhere from six to 20 kids each run, that some occasionally call for a third afternoon per week, even a 7 a.m. before-school meet-up (in which case they serve doughnuts). But treats are not the ultimate draw.</p>\n<p>\u201cI like the experience of being with my peers and actually doing something, all at the same time,\u201d 11-year-old Henry Gersick said. \u201cInstead of just sitting there.\u201d</p>\n<p>IT\u2019S COOL ON TIKTOK</p>\n<h2>Jump! Jump! Jump!</h2>\n<p>One of the most accessible, inexpensive, socially distanced sports is something you may not even realize is a sport. Since the pandemic began, jump-roping has become \u201ca TikTok craze,\u201d according to Nick Woodard, a 14-time world-champion jump-roper and founder of Learnin\u2019 the Ropes, a program designed to teach kids and adults the joy of jumping. \u201cAll you need is time, some space and a $5 jump rope, and you\u2019re good to go,\u201d Mr. Woodard said.</p>\n<p>Based in Bowling Green, Ky., Mr. Woodard and his wife, Kaylee (a six-time world champion in her own right), have been leading virtual workshops for children as young as 6, from Malaysia to Germany. A 30-minute class costs $35 for one child, and includes spiderwalk warmups, instruction, and challenges. (How many jumps can you do in 30 seconds?)</p>\n<p>\u201cThey have so much fun, they don\u2019t even realize they\u2019re getting exercise,\u201d Ms. Woodard said. But a selling point right now is that jumping rope \u2014 unlike team sports \u2014 is something you can do together, apart.</p>\n<p>A DOSE OF ADVENTURE</p>\n<h2>Take a hike with family and a friend.</h2>\n<p>\u201cMy kids are reluctant to do anything outdoors, unless we\u2019re meeting up with another family, then they\u2019re totally into it!\u201d said Ginny Yurich, founder of 1000 Hours Outside, a family-run Instagram account with over 112,000 followers that challenges youth to spend an average of 2.7 hours a day outdoors per year. \u201cMake sure you have food, a first-aid kit and friends \u2014 friends are the linchpin,\u201d she said. (Masks, too.)</p>\n<p>Ms. Yurich, a Michigan mother of five, drags her children on day hikes, yes, but also on evening lantern-lit hikes, rainy hikes and snowy walks. She was inspired, she said, by the 2017 book \u201cThere\u2019s No Such Thing as Bad Weather,\u201d by the Swedish-American author-blogger Linda McGurk, who espouses the Scandinavian concept of friluftsliv, or \u201copen-air living.\u201d For Ms. Yurich and Ms. McGurk, experiencing the outdoors is paramount to children\u2019s development and well-being.</p>\n<p>If you prefer not to pod during the pandemic, follow the lead of Dave Rubenstein, a father of two in Lawrence, Kan., by enacting \u201cForced Family Fun Time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe call it F.F.F.T.,\u201d Mr. Rubenstein said of the weekly activity. \u201cIt usually involves a hike around the lake in town, but it could be any outdoor activity teenagers typically hate. And if they complain, the punishment is more F.F.F.T.\u201d</p>\n<p>EXPERIENCING COMMUNITY \u2014 AND FREEDOM</p>\n<h2>Form a friendly neighborhood bike gang.</h2>\n<p>\u201cKids are biking like never before,\u201d said Jon Solomon, a spokeman for the Aspen Institute\u2019s Sports & Society Program, the nonprofit\u2019s initiative to help build healthy communities through sports. Over the year, leisure bike sales grew 203 percent year over year, he said.</p>\n<p>In one neighborhood in Denver, one neighbor has opened up a half-mile dirt bike track on his property to all the kids on the block. Wyatt Isgrig, 14, and his friends tackle it often by mountain bike, scooter or motorized dirt bike.</p>\n<p>Ali Freedman, a mother of two in Boston\u2019s Roslindale neighborhood, has loved watching children of all ages on her street playing together. \u201cEvery day around 3:30 p.m., kids we never knew before Covid come biking by our house asking \u2018Can you play?\u2019\u201d Ms. Freedman said.</p>\n<p>The young crew all wear masks \u2014 \u201cMoms have a text thread going to check on enforcement when masks become chin diapers,\u201d said Ms. Freedman, who peers out the window every so often \u2014 and best of all: \u201cThey stay out until dinner.\u201d</p>\n<p>CREATING SOMETHING NEW, TOGETHER</p>\n<h2>Invent your own game.</h2>\n<p>In a September survey conducted by the Aspen Institute and Utah State University in response to the coronavirus pandemic, 71 percent of parents said \u201cindividual games\u201d (like shooting baskets solo) were the form of sport with the highest comfort level for their kids, followed by classic neighborhood pickup games like basketball or tennis.</p>\n<p>But inventing your own game has its own rewards. One otherwise boring day in suburban Maryland, Mr. Solomon and his son, 11, came up with something they call hock-ball. It involves a hockey stick and a tennis ball and an empty sidewalk or street.</p>\n<p>Mr. Solomon attempted to explain. \u201cYou roll the tennis ball like a kickball \u2014 it could be smooth, or slow, or bouncy \u2014 and the person with the stick tries to hit it past the pitcher, then runs back and forth to home plate.\u201d There are points and innings and it\u2019s apparently fun for all ages. \u201cOnly problem is, the ball inevitably rolls under a parked car, \u201d Mr. Solomon said.</p>\n<p>A (COLD) SURGE OF HOMETOWN PRIDE</p>\n<h2>Bundle up for snow yoga.</h2>\n<p>In Milwaukee, where daily high temperatures in winter often hover below freezing, Kendra Cheng said her seventh grader will be doing much of the same as she did over the summer, only wearing more clothes: kickball, trampoline tag or even \u201cwater-skiing on land\u201d \u2014 which calls for two kids, a broken hammer, a rope, and Rollerblades (or cross-country skis).</p>\n<p>But the hot new thing in Ms. Cheng\u2019s neighborhood, she said, will be snow yoga, led by a certified yogi friend. Once it starts snowing, 10 to 20 people will gather twice a week at a safe distance in a private backyard with a backdrop of Lake Michigan. \u201cIn Wisconsin, we love the cold,\u201d Ms. Cheng said. \u201cWe love snowpants. We love barely being able to move because we have five layers on. And we\u2019re all excited to do downward dog outdoors to create our sweat.\u201d</p>\n<h2>If all else fails, bribe them.</h2>\n<p>Pay your kid \u2014 a dollar, a quarter, a penny \u2014 per minute to walk the pandemic puppy you just got.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt gets them out of the house and out of my hair \u2014 and they earn some money,\u201d said Murray Isgrig, parent of Wyatt in Denver. \u201cEven though they don\u2019t have anywhere to spend it.\u201d</p>"

                "subheadline": "Chris Ruddy, the C.E.O. of Newsmax, has found a business opportunity in feeding Trump supporters the fantasy that the president could still win the election.",
                "byline": "By Ben Smith",
                "body": "<p>In 2004, Hillary Clinton was in the Senate and Christopher Ruddy had some making up to do. He was, back then, best known as \u201cthe Inspector Clouseau\u201d of the Vince Foster case \u2014\u00a0a New York Post reporter who had popularized the baseless theory that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s friend, who committed suicide in 1993, had been murdered.</p>\n<p>But it now seemed possible that Mrs. Clinton might run for president, and Mr. Ruddy laid it on pretty thick. Mrs. Clinton was doing \u201ca remarkably and surprising good job for NY as Senator,\u201d he wrote to a mutual friend, former Mayor Ed Koch of New York. \u201cI might not like Hillary\u2019s liberalism, but I don\u2019t dislike her on a personal level \u2014 as I do Rudy. Rudy Giuliani is a bad person.\u201d</p>\n<p>I asked an amused former Clinton aide to dredge this correspondence out of an old box because Mr. Ruddy, a Long Island-born 55-year-old, has emerged as the most audacious media entrepreneur of the Trump election fantasy. The chief executive of Newsmax and part of President Trump\u2019s South Florida social circle, Mr. Ruddy has capitalized on the anger of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters at Fox News for delivering the unwelcome news, first in Arizona and then nationally, that Mr. Trump had lost his re-election campaign. On Newsmax, however, the fight is still on, the imaginary election-altering Kraken is yet to be released, Mr. Trump is striving valiantly for four more years and the ratings are incredible.</p>\n<p>Newsmax\u2019s prime-time ratings, which averaged 58,000 before Election Day, soared to 1.1 million afterward for its top shows, with one host, Greg Kelly, cheerleading on Twitter and on the air for \u201cthe QUEST TO COUNT all the LEGAL VOTES.\u201d The ratings even drew a congratulatory call from Mr. Trump himself, my colleagues Michael Grynbaum and John Koblin reported last week.</p>\n<p>But Mr. Ruddy, as those Clinton messages show, is not the sort of true-believing ideologue his viewers may imagine in the foxhole alongside them. He is, rather, perhaps the purest embodiment of another classic television type, the revenue-minded cynic for whom the substance of programming is just a path to money and power.</p>\n<p>All successful TV programmers have some mercenary in them, of course, but even by those standards, Mr. Ruddy is extreme. He has turned Newsmax into a pure vehicle for Trumpism, attacking Fox News from the right for including occasional dissenting voices. And when Trumpism turned this month from an electoral strategy into a hallucinatory attempt to overturn the election, Mr. Ruddy saw opportunity: Newsmax, available on cable in most American households and streaming online, became the home of alternate reality.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn this day and age, people want something that tends to affirm their views and opinions,\u201d Mr. Ruddy told me in an interview.</p>\n<p>He wasn\u2019t hard to reach. Like many people who get generally, even inexplicably, friendly media coverage, the genial Mr. Ruddy is always willing to talk to the press. He is, in fact, a rare and valuable commodity: someone with real access to Mr. Trump who will tell the truth on the record. His insights \u2014 62 quotes in The New York Times in the last four years, 61 in The Washington Post and 51 appearances on CNN \u2014 deliver what journalists crave: up-close insights about the president. He has even invited reporters to tag along to Mar-a-Lago as his guest at the president\u2019s private club, which has been a minor irritant for President Trump\u2019s staff, two former Trump aides told me. Not that he\u2019s made any secret of his strategy. The fake crisis of the U.S. electoral system is \u201cgreat for news,\u201d he told The New Yorker\u2019s Isaac Chotiner last week.</p>\n<p>Mr. Ruddy is hardly alone in the sudden scramble to convert Mr. Trump\u2019s political profile into cash.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are a lot of well-capitalized people circling,\u201d said Michael Clemente, a former executive at ABC News and Fox News and former chief executive of Newsmax, who has been part of conversations as a potential leader of a new venture. He describes the proposition as a question of math, and the dominance of liberal-leaning cable channels: \u201cFifty percent of the country has 90 percent of the news media speaking to them.\u201d</p>\n<p>The noisiest effort is led by Hicks Equity Partners, the family business of a Republican National Committee co-chairman and friend of Donald Trump Jr., Thomas Hicks Jr. The Hicks group has sought to lead buyouts of both Newsmax and its smaller and stranger rival, the One America News Network. The group is also pursuing a third strategy, according to a confidential investment proposal I obtained, which would focus on culture rather than news: building \u201ca family-friendly programming destination of broad appeal based on traditional values\u201d by buying and merging a small \u201cequestrian sports and lifestyle\u201d channel and a larger one, which a person briefed on the talks identified as the small, independent Ride-TV and Great American Country, which is owned by the cable behemoth Discovery. (A spokesman for Hicks Equity Partners didn\u2019t respond to an inquiry about a potential deal.)</p>\n<p>Other possibilities for the president to cash in on his stature include creating a new Trump TV network from scratch, either as a television broadcast channel, a package of online video or even a way to direct cash into the Trump family political operation.</p>\n<p>Mr. Ruddy has a head start. His main commercial advantage is the network\u2019s distribution, which the company says puts it in 70 million of the roughly 90 million American homes that have cable, thanks to deals with the largest distributors, Comcast and AT&T. It\u2019s a laborious, and expensive, process to get onto the cable package \u2014\u00a0even if you are, as Newsmax currently is, way up the dial. The programming is also available through a livestream on its app and on a range of newer \u201cover-the-top\u201d TV platforms like Roku. (OAN claims to be available in about half as many cable homes.) The process of establishing a cable network is also deeply political, as things often are in monopolistic industries: Newsmax was dropped from AT&T\u2019s DirectTV in 2016, and restored the next year after Senator Charles E. Grassley called the move \u201cunfair\u201d during hearings about AT&T\u2019s attempt to acquire Time Warner. You could imagine executives at Comcast and AT&T taking their time to make a deal with Trump TV.</p>\n<p>But Mr. Ruddy also has a problem. His TV business, a speculative bet that could be worth billions if it can cut deeply into Fox\u2019s audience, currently loses money. The company invested $70 million from 2014 to 2017, according to a confidential overview produced for potential investors in 2018 that one of them shared with me. And Mr. Ruddy told me Newsmax is still investing.</p>\n<p>Those costs are partly because new channels often pay cable companies to get on TV. Mr. Ruddy declined to describe his specific arrangements with the cable providers, but said, \u201cIt\u2019s not unusual for companies to do that when they start out.\u201d And it\u2019s partly because big advertisers have fled right-wing talk shows, leaving even the widely viewed prime-time shows on Fox News with less lucrative \u201cdirect response\u201d ads for pillows and medical devices.</p>\n<p>Newsmax has inverted the usual media business dynamic. The company is losing money on television, and making it on the internet, though Mr. Ruddy told me he expects that \u201crevenues on cable and OTT television will be more robust and consistent than the online business for the next 10 years.\u201d</p>\n<p>Newsmax has built a solid, and unusual, business by catering to the 50-and-older demographic it described in the document shared with investors as \u201cBoomers and Beyond.\u201d The website\u2019s voice, its big and lucrative email lists, and its products, from books to magazines to vitamin supplements, have the tone of conservative direct mail. And it\u2019s working: The company projected its 2018 revenues at more than $59 million, divided among advertising, subscriptions and e-commerce. (One sponsor on the app last week was selling health advice, asking \u201cIs the \u2018Pandemic\u2019 a Lie?\u201d)</p>\n<p>Newsmax has been raising money to finance its TV ambitions. Private equity from \u201ca couple of investors,\u201d Mr. Ruddy said, has paid to upgrade studios and hire figures like Mr. Kelly and the former White House press secretary Sean Spicer as the hosts of shows that replaced hours of World War II documentaries, and carry conservative radio talkers including Howie Carr from Boston. The investors, he said, are domestic, despite a Politico report (picked up on Breitbart) indicating he was in talks to raise money from Qatar. Mr. Ruddy said he sent proposals to many sovereign wealth funds, among others, but has not taken foreign investment. He blames his former rival, Stephen Bannon, for pushing the Qatar story, but such grudges are fleeting in the often-shifting alliances of the new right: Mr. Bannon\u2019s podcast, \u201cWar Room,\u201d is now also broadcast on Newsmax late at night on weekdays.</p>\n<p>Newsmax now needs to raise more money, or sell fast, if it\u2019s going to keep upgrading its talent and production quality to press its advantage with Fox News \u2014 which has begun nervously trying to block guests from appearing on the network.</p>\n<p>When I pressed Mr. Ruddy on why he was stringing along his audience with a story he can\u2019t, really, himself believe \u2014 that Mr. Trump won the election \u2014 he didn\u2019t really defend it. Instead, he countered that he wasn\u2019t the only one. \u201cFor two years, the liberal media pushed this Russian hoax theory, and there didn\u2019t seem to be any substantiation at the end of the day and it was a pretty compelling, gripping story \u2014\u00a0controversial personalities, things happened, sparks were flying,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Newsmax continues to tell a gripping story. On Friday night, Mr. Kelly referred to Joe Biden\u2019s \u201calleged victory,\u201d hosted a long interview with Rudy Giuliani and later turned to an analyst who gave Mr. Trump a \u201c35 to 40 percent chance that he wins this.\u201d The 8 p.m. host, Grant Stinchfield, announced that \u201cthe momentum seems to be shifting back to the president\u2019s favor,\u201d and interviewed a lawyer for Mr. Trump, Jenna Ellis, and a Pennsylvania state senator trying to take back the state\u2019s election certification.</p>\n<p>Mr. Ruddy\u2019s cynicism brings me back to the most trenchant attack from conservative media on the mainstream media: that journalists think conservatives are stupid. Tucker Carlson regularly tells his audience that the college-educated snobs in New York who preside over the major outlets view conservatives as unsophisticated rubes, misled by misinformation, not as people who actually believe in the ideas pushed by Mr. Trump, like immigration should be sharply curtailed. Those attacks on the media are often false, but the coastal media sometimes does fail to understand people who aren\u2019t like them, left and right, and sometimes they patronize their audiences.</p>\n<p>But nobody I\u2019ve ever covered treats an audience with the blithe disdain of Mr. Ruddy. He has them watching a great story \u2014\u00a0a thriller, a whodunit \u2014\u00a0about a stolen election. He thinks they\u2019re stupid enough to fall for it, dumb enough to keep watching even after the fantasy inevitably dissolves, buying the supplements and the books and, crucially, tuning in to channel 1115 in large enough numbers that, eventually, the cable companies will pay him.</p>\n<p>Perhaps he actually thinks his viewers are that dumb. Or maybe he just needs them to stick around long enough for him to find someone just as cynical, but with more cash on hand, to buy him out.</p>"

                "byline": "By Shawn Hubler and Alexander Burns",
                "body": "<p>SACRAMENTO \u2014 Since Gavin Newsom\u2019s days as a young upstart running for mayor of San Francisco through more than two decades of public life, Alex Padilla has been a stalwart ally.</p>\n<p>As president of the Los Angeles City Council, Mr. Padilla introduced Mr. Newsom to important local labor and Latino leaders. As a state senator, Mr. Padilla chaired Mr. Newsom\u2019s short-lived first campaign for governor. And as California secretary of state, Mr. Padilla conferred a key early endorsement that helped Mr. Newsom win the governor\u2019s seat in 2018.</p>\n<p>[Sign up for California Today, our daily newsletter from the Golden State.]</p>\n<p>Now Mr. Newsom is in a position to return the favor: He must appoint someone to fill the soon-to-be-vacant U.S. Senate seat of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. Though many names have been floated to succeed Ms. Harris, Mr. Padilla has emerged as the front-runner, according to more than a half-dozen advisers, political consultants and fellow lawmakers familiar with the governor\u2019s thinking.</p>\n<p>Yet nearly a month after Ms. Harris\u2019s election, Mr. Newsom has not yet named a successor \u2014 and the pressure is mounting.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, all roads lead to Alex Padilla,\u201d said Nathalie Rayes, president of the Latino Victory Fund, which has waged a \u201cPick Padilla\u201d campaign since August. \u201cI think the longer he waits \u2014 well, I would have done this a long time ago, but I\u2019m not the governor of California.\u201d</p>\n<p>Since President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. chose Ms. Harris as his running mate in August, the question of her successor has been a matter of high-stakes speculation. Mr. Newsom faces extraordinary crosscurrents of factional rivalry and identity politics in a state where the Democratic Party is thoroughly defined by both.</p>\n<p>He has spoken about the Senate appointment not as a political bauble that he is eager to dispense, but as a burdensome task that is likelier to generate grudges than personal gratitude and popular excitement. That sense of looming peril has only deepened in recent days, following news that Mr. Newsom breached his own administration\u2019s public-health guidance to attend an extravagant birthday gathering at the French Laundry restaurant for a longtime political adviser.</p>\n<p>Critics have seized on the faux pas, adding to the challenges Mr. Newsom already has as his state grapples with a terrifying surge of Covid-19, ongoing problems in its unemployment benefits system and an imminent loss of the federal stimulus funds that underwrote temporary shelter for tens of thousands of homeless people during the pandemic.</p>\n<p>Asked last week about the Senate appointment, Mr. Newsom sidestepped.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat determination has not yet been made,\u201d he said, speaking from his home, where he was in quarantine after three of his four children were revealed to have been in contact with a California Highway Patrol officer who later tested positive for Covid-19.</p>\n<p>He said he hadn\u2019t laid out a timeline for the decision, beyond that it must be made before Jan. 20, when Ms. Harris is sworn in as vice president. But, he added, \u201cprogress has been made.\u201d</p>\n<p>The uncertainty has made room for lobbying by an array of aspirants and their political proxies. During some weeks it has seemed that the list of candidates for the post has continued to grow rather than narrowing toward an eventual selection.</p>\n<p>Democratic leaders have sought to tug Mr. Newsom in different directions, playing on what they see as his short- and long-term political aspirations. Some argue that he must appoint a Black candidate if he hopes to prevail someday in a Democratic presidential primary, others that he must name a Latino to win a comfortable re-election in 2022, still others that Ms. Harris must be replaced by another woman or that he must placate progressives if he wants to govern successfully in an ongoing fiscal crunch.</p>\n<p>This is in addition to the hard fundamentals of campaigning statewide in California, which both the governor and Senator Harris\u2019s successor will have to do in 2022, when their terms end. California, the most populous state, has myriad subcultures \u2014 north and south, coastal and inland \u2014 and primary campaigns alone can cost millions of dollars.</p>\n<p>Though Republicans are less than a quarter of registered voters in the state, another third or so of the electorate has no party preference and turnout drops in off-year elections. Whomever Mr. Newsom appoints will need not only experience but the cash, the campaign operation and the charisma to turn out Democrats from the Mexican border to the Oregon state line.</p>\n<p>Mr. Newsom has held conversations with a few potential appointees, though he does not appear to have conducted formal interviews for the job, people familiar with the process said.</p>\n<p>Mr. Padilla, 47, has emerged as the favorite of Latino lawmakers, advocacy groups and a number of labor officials, and his circle of political advisers overlaps significantly with Mr. Newsom\u2019s. The middle son of Mexican-born parents \u2014 a short-order cook from Jalisco and a housekeeper from Chihuahua \u2014 Mr. Padilla worked his way through the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, earning a degree in 1994 in mechanical engineering.</p>\n<p>He and his siblings still live within five miles of the house where they grew up in Pacoima, Calif., in the San Fernando Valley. His original plan, he says, was to work in aerospace but the anti-immigrant politics that swept California in the early 1990s propelled him instead to political activism.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat really was a wake-up call,\u201d he said last week, chopping onions for pumpkin chili as he spoke from his home. Relatives chattered in the background; he and his wife, Angela, have three children and his mother-in-law lives with them. \u201cI knew I\u2019d have to do my part or our community would continue to be scapegoated.\u201d</p>\n<p>After his graduation, he worked in the office of Senator Dianne Feinstein. By 1999, he was a 26-year-old city councilman representing his old neighborhood. By 2001, he was the youngest-ever City Council president of Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>In the State Senate, where he spent eight years, Mr. Padilla chaired Mr. Newsom\u2019s 2009 bid for governor before Jerry Brown got into the race and Mr. Newsom dropped out, running for lieutenant governor instead.</p>\n<p>In 2014, Mr. Padilla ran for the secretary of state\u2019s office on a promise to register a million new California voters. As a result of legislation he pushed that registers Californians to vote when they get a driver\u2019s license, the state has added more than 4 million.</p>\n<p>Exit polls showed that a third of California\u2019s electorate this year was Latino, a group that makes up 40 percent of the state\u2019s population. Yet the state has never elected a Latino senator or governor. Mr. Newsom helped ensure that lockout continued in the 2018 elections, when he trounced one of the state\u2019s most prominent Latino Democrats, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, in a primary election.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a failure by both political parties to champion the needs of a growing electorate,\u201d said Sonja Diaz, director of the Latino Policy and Politics Initiative at the University of California, Los Angeles. Choosing a Latino for one of the nation\u2019s most powerful posts, she added, would help reverse that.</p>\n<p>But other Latino candidates also have supporters. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, 62, has run and won statewide and has represented Los Angeles in Congress; his name also has come up as a potential member of the Biden cabinet.</p>\n<p>And Mayor Robert Garcia of Long Beach, the city\u2019s first openly gay mayor, has an enthusiastic base. In addition to leading what would be the biggest city in many other states, Mr. Garcia\u2019s history-making personal biography and charisma have earned him attention in the national Democratic Party.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, Mr. Garcia \u2014 who has been a backer since 2009 of Gov. Newsom \u2014 said addressing a coronavirus surge hammering Los Angeles County is his top priority at the moment and would not speak at length about the Senate vacancy.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnybody would be honored to serve their country in that way,\u201d Mr. Garcia, 42, said \u201cBut I\u2019m going to support whoever the governor selects.\u201d</p>\n<p>Should Mr. Newsom elevate a statewide officer like Mr. Padilla or Mr. Becerra to the Senate, it would also create a new vacancy for him to fill \u2014 potentially furnishing him with a consolation prize for a person or group disappointed by his Senate decision.</p>\n<p>Still, active campaigns are underway to urge Mr. Newsom to replace Ms. Harris with a woman, particularly a Black woman. Led by longtime state Democrats like Willie Brown and groups of high-dollar female donors, they note that when Ms. Harris resigns and assumes her new office, the Senate will once again have no Black female members. The number of women of color in the chamber would drop by a quarter to just three: Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii and Catherine Cortez-Masto of Nevada.</p>\n<p>At least two Black women in California\u2019s House delegation are pursuing the appointment: Representatives Barbara Lee, 74, and Karen Bass, 67, though Ms. Lee is seen as mounting the far more determined campaign for the job. Ms. Bass, who was vetted for the vice presidency last summer, is under consideration for potential cabinet jobs in the Biden administration as well.</p>\n<p>Neither endorsed the governor during the 2018 Democratic primary. But both women are highly regarded on the left, as is a third member of the House delegation who is interested in joining the Senate, Representative Ro Khanna, 44, a former co-chairman of the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign.</p>\n<p>Asian-American leaders in the state have also encouraged Mr. Newsom to consider choosing a member of the increasingly organized community, such as Mr. Khanna or Representative Judy Chu, who chairs the Asian Pacific American Caucus in the House.</p>\n<p>Another prominent progressive, Representative Katie Porter of Orange County, is seen as a probable candidate for the Senate at some point, but perhaps more likely to seek the seat currently held by Ms. Feinstein, who is 87 and announced this week she was stepping down as the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee.</p>\n<p>There are practical reasons, however, why it may make sense for Mr. Newsom to avoid an appointment from the House. Democrats are expected to hold only a tiny majority in the chamber in January and that number could shave down even further if lawmakers accept appointments for jobs in the Biden administration.</p>\n<p>Some Democrats have also suggested a long shot option that Mr. Newsom could appoint a distinguished figure in the late stages of their public life, who would serve out the remaining two years of Ms. Harris\u2019s term without seeking re-election \u2014 someone like Dolores Huerta, the civil rights leader and labor organizer, who is 90, or Mr. Brown, who is 82.</p>\n<p>For the moment, Mr. Padilla downplayed the urgency of Mr. Newsom\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s a deliberate person with tons on his plate,\u201d said Mr. Padilla. \u201cThere are wildfires. There\u2019s Covid. He has a budget due in January. This is just one more significant item.\u201d</p>\n<p>But Ms. Rayes of the Latino Victory Fund was less patient.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know other people have their favorites, and I guess he\u2019s just really feeling the pressure,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it would be easier to just come out with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shawn Hubler reported from Sacramento and Alexander Burns from Rehoboth Beach, Del.

But it is precisely Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to flout diplomatic protocol, abandon international accords and keep his opponents off-balance that have earned him plaudits as a leader strong enough to stand up to dictators and defend democratic ideals overseas, even if he has been criticized as diminishing them at home.</p>\n<p>As President-elect Biden assembles his foreign-policy team, prominent human rights activists across Asia are worried about his desire for the United States to hew again to international norms. They believe that Mr. Biden, like former President Barack Obama, will pursue accommodation rather than confrontation in the face of China\u2019s assertive moves. And their pro-Trump views have been cemented by online misinformation, often delivered by dubious news sources, that Mr. Biden is working in tandem with communists or is a closet socialist sympathizer.</p>\n<p>\u201cBiden is president, and it\u2019s like having Xi Jinping sitting in the White House,\u201d said Elmer Yuen, a Hong Kong entrepreneur who has posted YouTube videos criticizing the Chinese Communist Party, or C.C.P. \u201cHe wants to coexist with China, and whoever coexists with the C.C.P. loses.\u201d</p>\n<p>With Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential tenure in its twilight, these activists are calling for the administration to make a final stand against Asian autocrats, similar to a last-ditch effort to expand the border wall with Mexico.</p>\n<p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took a five-nation swing through Asia in October in which he abandoned politesse and described the Chinese government as a \u201cpredator,\u201d \u201clawless and threatening,\u201d and \u201cthe gravest threat to the future of religious freedom.\u201d The tour was meant as a counterweight to China in a region where Beijing\u2019s dollar diplomacy has bought significant influence.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, Lobsang Sangay became the first head of the Tibetan government-in-exile to visit the White House; the provocative invite infuriated Beijing, which considers Mr. Sangay to be a separatist.</p>\n<p>In June, Mr. Pompeo attended a virtual gathering with the Hong Kong democracy leader Joshua Wong and President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan, both of whom are loathed by the Chinese government.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump\u2019s popularity is particularly enduring among Christians, such as Chinese-born legal scholars chafing against Communism\u2019s atheist core and ethnic minority activists in Southeast Asia. Mr. Pompeo and other Trump administration officials, they believe, have been fulfilling a faith-based mission overseas.</p>\n<p>Last year, Mr. Trump met in the White House with a group of religious leaders from across the world, including Hkalam Samson, the president of the Kachin Baptist Convention, which represents the persecuted Christian Kachin minority in Myanmar.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy experience in the White House, when I was given one minute to speak out about the Kachin, meant a lot, and it also meant that Trump cares about us,\u201d Mr. Samson said. \u201cTrump is better for the Kachin than Biden.\u201d</p>\n<p>Skepticism for Mr. Biden extends to those fighting for secular political rights as well. The president-elect\u2019s embrace of diplomatic custom will not work when only one side is playing fairly, they say.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor Biden\u2019s policies toward China, the part about making China play by the international rules, I think, is very hollow,\u201d said Wang Dan, who helped lead the 1989 Tiananmen protests as a university student. \u201cAs we know, the Chinese Communist Party hardly abides by international rules.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe United States must realize that there will be no improvements on human rights issues in China if there is no regime change,\u201d Mr. Wang added. He has continued to question Mr. Trump\u2019s electoral loss, baseless claims shared by other prominent Chinese-born dissidents.</p>\n<p>But others within the community, particularly in Hong Kong and China, said that backing Mr. Trump was hypocritical at best and dangerous at worst.</p>\n<p>\u201cTrump\u2019s human rights record \u2014 what he does to migrant children, the Muslim ban, white supremacy, alternative truth \u2014 removes him from my support, but this is apparently not the popular attitude among many dissidents in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan,\u201d said Badiucao, a China-born political artist who now lives in self-exile in Australia.</p>\n<p>Mr. Badiucao, who is known by a pseudonym to protect his family in China, has skirmished online with Mr. Wang and other well-known dissidents and has made the scuffle a topic for his art.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese guys are utilitarian, and they believe that if Trump is waging war against the C.C.P. then he\u2019s right for them,\u201d Mr. Badiucao said. \u201cThat mentality fits the whole \u2018America First\u2019 ideology, where it\u2019s OK for other people to suffer if your goal is met, and their goal is overthrowing the C.C.P.\u201d</p>\n<p>Over the past 12 months, the Trump administration has stepped up its actions in Asia.</p>\n<p>Late last year, the U.S. government barred military leaders from Myanmar from entering the country because of their role in what Mr. Pompeo called \u201cgross violations of human rights\u201d of Rohingya Muslims and other minority groups. Financial sanctions were also placed on individuals in Pakistan and Cambodia, among other countries, where civil liberties are under threat.</p>\n<p>This summer, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Carrie Lam, the chief executive of Hong Kong, and 10 others for \u201cundermining Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy and restricting the freedom of expression or assembly of the citizens of Hong Kong.\u201d Four more officials were added to the sanctions list this month.</p>\n<p>In June, Mr. Trump signed legislation that led to sanctions being placed on Chinese officials who have overseen the construction of mass detention camps in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, where more than a million people, mostly members of the Uighur Muslim minority, have been imprisoned.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Trump administration by far has done more to raise our issue than all other countries combined,\u201d said Salih Hudayar, who was born in Xinjiang and moved to the United States as a child. \u201cI\u2019m very skeptical of a Biden administration because I am worried he will allow China to go back to normal, which is a 21st-century genocide of the Uighurs.\u201d</p>\n<p>During the presidential campaign, Mr. Biden released a statement calling the situation in Xinjiang a \u201cgenocide.\u201d The Trump administration has not used such a designation, and a book by his former national security adviser said that Mr. Trump told Mr. Xi that he should continue building the detention camps in Xinjiang.</p>\n<p>Foreign policy advisers to Mr. Biden say that it is unfair to presume that he will continue the Obama administration\u2019s moderate stance. It is, they say, a different era. The recent human rights legislation championed by the Trump administration has received broad bipartisan support.</p>\n<p>And some Asian dissidents acknowledge that the antipathy toward Mr. Biden is driven in part by a deluge of online misinformation that paints the president-elect as a secret socialist or contends, without any proof, that foreign \u201ccommunist money\u201d turned the election against Mr. Trump. Such unsubstantiated claims have been repeated by niche online publications in Vietnamese, Chinese and other languages.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe crisis of democracy in the world makes people, especially activists, confused and susceptible to the influence of conspiracy theories and information manipulation,\u201d said Nguyen Quang A, a Vietnamese dissident who has been detained multiple times for his criticism of the country\u2019s communist leadership. \u201cVietnam doesn\u2019t have independent media, and people, especially activists, already hate mainstream media.\u201d</p>\n<p>One of the most influential voices spreading false narratives about Mr. Biden and the election on Twitter is Ai Weiwei, the Chinese contemporary artist who now lives in overseas exile.</p>\n<p>In an interview, Mr. Ai said that he was not a fan of Mr. Trump. For his art, he has posed at Trump properties with his middle finger raised. But Mr. Ai said that by shutting off debate on his social media feed, he would be no different than an authoritarian government like China\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll over Asia, all over the world, people don\u2019t have the right to speak,\u201d he said. \u201cIn America, left or right, you have personal freedoms. This has to be protected.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chau Doan contributed reporting from Hanoi, Vietnam; Elaine Yu from Hong Kong; and Saw Nang from Yangon, Myanmar.</p>"

                "subheadline": "Delivery drivers have been essential to feeding New York, while boosting sales for companies like DoorDash and Uber. But they say work conditions have gotten worse.",
                "byline": "By Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura",
                "body": "<p>When the pandemic lockdown led the Manhattan restaurant where Natanael Evangelista was an employee to close for good, he quickly shifted to working for food delivery apps. He had few options. He was undocumented, did not speak much English and needed money badly. He owed months\u2019 worth of rent, and his family in Mexico needed help.</p>\n<p>But he was worried. Two of his cousins were also delivery workers \u2014 one had contracted the coronavirus and fallen into a coma, while the other had been assaulted and had his bike stolen.</p>\n<p>With hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers out of work and the city\u2019s unemployment rate at 13.2 percent, many desperate people have turned to working for food delivery apps like DoorDash, Uber Eats and Grubhub, which have seen huge demand from customers who are working from home.</p>\n<p>While delivery drivers have been essential to feeding New Yorkers and keeping them safe, their working conditions, already precarious before the pandemic, have gotten worse.</p>\n<p>The recent surge in cases means greater risk of exposure traveling from restaurants to homes. Rising crime in New York City has also led to instances of assault and bicycle theft.</p>\n<p>\u201cDelivery work is a dangerous business,\u201d Mr. Evangelista, 27, said. \u201cIt\u2019s very worrying.\u201d</p>\n<p>Some workers also complain that many restaurants deny them the use of their bathroom out of health concerns, forcing them to carry plastic bottles.</p>\n<p>Even as the food delivery companies have seen sales surge, the workers\u2019 pay has remained erratic. Because the drivers are independent workers, they are not entitled to a minimum wage, overtime or any other benefits, like health insurance. Undocumented immigrants, who are not eligible for unemployment or federal coronavirus assistance, make up the bulk of the work force in New York.</p>\n<p>The added competition from the surge in new workers has compounded the financial challenges. While there are no precise figures, advocacy groups estimate that there were roughly 50,000 delivery workers before the pandemic \u2014 a number they say has grown exponentially. Uber alone said it had added 36,000 couriers in New York since March.</p>\n<p>DoorDash and Uber said they had provided extra help to delivery drivers during the pandemic, including offering sick pay to those who had gotten the virus. DoorDash, the nation\u2019s largest food delivery app, said it provided masks, gloves, hand sanitizer and wipes to drivers, as well as access to low-cost telemedicine appointments.</p>\n<p>\u201cSince the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis, we have taken action to protect and support Dashers who are on the front lines,\u201d Becky Sosnov, a spokeswoman for DoorDash, said. </p>\n<p>DoorDash said it had changed its pay model, which came under fire last year after it was revealed that tips were being used to subsidize its payments to workers. The company recently reached a $2.5 million settlement with prosecutors in Washington, D.C., after being accused of misleading consumers over how it tipped its workers.</p>\n<p>At Uber Eats, \u201cdelivery people receive 100 percent of all tips,\u201d Meghan Casserly, a spokeswoman for the company, said. She said Uber Eats has provided 10 million safety supplies \u2014 masks, wipes and hand sanitizer \u2014 to workers in the United States and Canada.</p>\n<p>But workers interviewed for this article who drive for other food delivery apps said they still sometimes do not receive all of their tips. </p>\n<p>Some food delivery apps say drivers can earn as much as $22 per hour, including tips, though many drivers said they never earned anywhere close to that much.</p>\n<p>At a park on Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side, Edgar Usac, a delivery driver, was waiting for orders on a recent Saturday. After four hours, he said, he had made $11. Another driver, Elias Pacheco, 35, said: \u201cI have made $32 so far. I started at 10:30 this morning.\u201d It was 5 p.m.</p>\n<p>Drivers for food delivery apps are typically paid per delivery depending on the estimated duration and distance of a trip, plus tips. The work can be convenient for people supplementing a main source of income, but a struggle for those who depend on it as a primary job, advocates for the workers said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe pandemic really exacerbated the challenges that these workers are facing and that they regularly face,\u201d said Maria Figueroa, director of labor and policy research for the Cornell University Worker Institute. \u201cIn addition to getting low pay, they don\u2019t get enough work from each of the applications, so they have to work for at least three or four of them, and there are more workers than the market can hold.\u201d</p>\n<p>Treating the drivers as essentially freelancers, Ms. Figueroa said, has allowed the food delivery apps to offset what have been thin profit margins by not having to pay for health insurance, retirement benefits or workers\u2019 compensation for injuries on the job.</p>\n<p>On good days, Mr. Evangelista makes roughly $100 after working five to six hours, but other days he can make as little as $42. In his old job, working in the kitchen of a restaurant in Midtown Manhattan, he made about $15 an hour, he said.</p>\n<p>Workers said food delivery apps do not always give them all of their tips, or sometimes deduct them from their pay.</p>\n<p>Gustavo Ajche, 37, a construction worker who turned to food delivery apps when he lost his job during New York\u2019s lockdown in the spring, said he was blocked by one app, Relay, after he complained that he had not received his tips. \u201cThey don\u2019t care,\u2019\u2019 he said.</p>\n<p>In one case, a $10 tip he had received from a customer appeared on the restaurant receipt, which he showed to a reporter \u2014 but not on his Relay app or in his bank account.</p>\n<p>Alex Blum, the chief executive of Relay, a small company that delivers mainly in New York City, attributed the error to the restaurant\u2019s failure to manually enter the tip into the Relay system.</p>\n<p>Mr. Blum said Relay paid its delivery workers $11.80 an hour, the city\u2019s minimum wage, even in between deliveries. But the company has been the target of numerous lawsuits from workers who claim that they are not paid fairly for the hours they work.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey don\u2019t think about you, your life, your bicycle,\u201d said Otoniel Timoteo, 36, who turned to delivery work in May after being laid off from a restaurant in Queens where he worked as a waiter. \u201cWe cannot make demands, otherwise they will block you. But we have no choice. How can we live?\u201d</p>\n<p>The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission two years ago adopted a $17.22 per hour minimum wage for drivers for ride-hailing apps like Uber and Lyft, but it does not apply to delivery workers. Efforts in New York State to provide more rights to gig workers by reclassifying them as employees have stalled in the Legislature.</p>\n<p>In California, companies that employ gig workers won a major victory on Election Day when voters approved a ballot referendum that allowed the companies to continue treating the workers as independent contractors.</p>\n<p>Across the nation, the demand for takeout during the pandemic has been a boon for food delivery apps. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe pandemic has certainly been a nice tailwind for revenue growth, and it has also helped them start to close the gap towards profitability in a speedier fashion,\u201d said Tom White, a senior internet analyst at D.A. Davidson, a wealth management firm.</p>\n<p>Uber\u2019s delivery service brought in $1.45 billion in sales nationwide between July and September compared with $645 million during the same period last year.</p>\n<p>DoorDash, which also owns another food delivery app, Caviar, reported revenue of $1.92 billion in the nine months through September, compared with $587 million for the same period last year, according to a prospectus filed earlier this year for its planned initial public offering. It recorded 543 million orders through September, compared with 181 million in the same period last year.</p>\n<p>Even before Mr. Evangelista took his first food app order, the requirements for the job pushed him deeper into debt.</p>\n<p>His electric bicycle set him back $2,000. Two locks for the bike cost about $200. He had to buy a helmet. He even paid out of his own pocket for a $65 tote bag from Postmates, another food delivery app, to carry orders, he said.</p>\n<p>His younger brother, Enoc, also laid off from a restaurant job, recently signed up to be a delivery worker. Mr. Evangelista could not suggest an alternative.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe pay is not good, but there aren\u2019t good jobs out there anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to work and survive the best way we can.\u201d</p>"

The holiday shopping season started with a bang. But only online.</p>\n<p>Consumers spent $9 billion on the web on Friday, a 21.6 percent increase over Black Friday in 2019. The surge in online sales is expected to be outdone today during Cyber Monday, a promotional event that internet retailers concocted in 2005.</p>\n<p>Physical stores, however, appear to have had more of a \u201cbleak Friday.\u201d A large portion of consumer spending had moved online long before the pandemic, but the global health crisis is accelerating that trend.</p>\n<p>The holiday shopping season comes at a critical moment for the U.S. economy, which is struggling again as the number of coronavirus cases is soaring amid colder weather.</p>\n<p>Today, President-elect Joe Biden formally announced his top economic advisers. His team is stocked with champions of organized labor and marginalized workers, signaling an early focus on a recovery from the pandemic recession.</p>\n<p>2. Medical experts say the coming months \u201care going to be just horrible.\u201d</p>\n<p>Some say the coronavirus death toll by March may be close to twice the 250,000 figure that the U.S. surpassed only last week. Our epidemiology reporter, Donald McNeil, warns that even as vaccines advance and the medical response to the virus improves, the politics of public health remain a deeply vexing challenge.</p>\n<p>On the bright side, the drugmaker Moderna said today it would apply to the Food and Drug Administration to authorize its coronavirus vaccine for emergency use. The first injections can be given as early as Dec. 21 if the process goes smoothly and approval is granted.</p>\n<p>Here you can build your own dashboard to track the coronavirus in places important to you.</p>\n<p>3. Republicans kept up their challenges to the election.</p>\n<p>On Dec. 8, the nation\u2019s voting results will be considered final. </p>\n<p>Still, in the past week, Republicans have made last-ditch efforts to halt or reverse the certification process in Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin (which approved its results today, as did Arizona). Above, Joe Biden campaigning in Wisconsin in September. </p>\n<p>There are also two federal lawsuits pending in Michigan and Georgia courts. And Republicans have at least one path to the nation\u2019s highest court: After the Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday rejected their attempts to stop or reverse the certification of Pennsylvania\u2019s results, President Trump\u2019s lawyers vowed to ask the Supreme Court to reconsider the case.</p>\n<p>4. U.S. markets ended November with large gains. </p>\n<p>Even with a small decline today, the S&P 500 jumped by 10.8 percent in November, its best monthly showing since April and the fourth-best month for the index in 30 years. The Dow Jones industrial average posted its biggest monthly gain since 1987.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin, too, achieved a record. The price of the cryptocurrency hit $19,850.11, nearly three years after its last high. Bitcoin has soared since March, after sinking below $4,000 at the outset of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>\n<p>But in one of the biggest retail collapses in Britain since the start of the pandemic, Arcadia Group, the company that includes the Topshop clothing chain, has gone into administration, a form of bankruptcy.</p>\n<p>5. Who counts when it comes to redrawing congressional districts?</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court heard arguments today on President Trump\u2019s efforts to exclude unauthorized immigrants from the calculations used to allocate seats in the House.</p>\n<p>A ruling for the Trump administration would upend the agreement that the Census Bureau must count all residents, whatever their immigration status, which has governed the count for more than two centuries.</p>\n<p>The decision could shift political power from Democratic states and districts to areas that are older, whiter and typically more Republican.</p>\n<p>6. An army of angry farmers is encircling New Delhi.</p>\n<p>The tens of thousands of protesters, many of whom traveled hundreds of miles in tractors and trailers, are upset about recent agricultural policies imposed in India, where more than 60 percent of the population depends on agriculture to make a living.</p>\n<p>They are digging in, resupplying themselves with food, fuel, firewood and medical supplies to stay put for weeks. Above, farmers at the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border in Ghazipur today.</p>\n<p>Many of the farmers say the new rules, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government pushed through Parliament in September, are the beginning of the end of a decades-old system that had guaranteed minimum prices for certain crops.</p>\n<p>7. A runoff for a House seat with stakes that could not be much lower.</p>\n<p>Two high-stakes runoff elections in Georgia in January will determine which party controls the U.S. Senate. Then there is the other Georgia runoff.</p>\n<p>Kwanza Hall and Robert Franklin, both Democrats, are competing in a vote tomorrow for a House term that ends at noon on Jan. 3. That means the winner will not even spend a full month in Congress, and will have no chance for an extension. </p>\n<p>Still, the candidates say their bids are anything but inconsequential. The victor will serve what would have been the final days of John Lewis\u2019s 17th term representing Georgia\u2019s Fifth Congressional District. Mr. Lewis, the pioneering civil rights leader, died in July.</p>\n<p>8. The crown prince of Japan just approved his daughter\u2019s marriage to a commoner. But there\u2019s a hitch.</p>\n<p>Princess Mako, above right, the eldest daughter of Crown Prince Akishino, and Kei Komuro, above left, an aspiring lawyer, have been engaged since 2017 and had been counting on marrying this year.</p>\n<p>But in remarks released today, the crown prince said that while he respected their union, there appeared to be opposition from the Japanese public, making it difficult to proceed with an official ceremony. He suggested that Mr. Komuro had not overcome concerns about his mother\u2019s financial affairs.</p>\n<p>The couple have not said when they plan to reschedule the wedding.</p>\n<p>9.

                "byline": "By Michael Paulson",
                "body": "<p>For all his flaws, that cranky old miser Ebenezer Scrooge has been a godsend for American theaters. Through recessions and blizzards and other upheavals, he has drawn small children and big money to his redemption story in \u201cA Christmas Carol.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stage adaptations of the tale, which generally run between Thanksgiving and year-end, have been a tradition and a lifeline for troupes big and small, professional and amateur. But now, after decades in which the Dickens classic has sustained them, this year theaters are sustaining Dickens.</p>\n<p>Gone are the large-cast extravaganzas playing before cheery crowds in packed venues. Instead, theaters are using every contagion-reduction strategy they have honed during the coronavirus pandemic: outdoor stagings, drive-in productions, street theater, streaming video, radio plays and even a do-it-yourself kit sent by mail.</p>\n<p>Many of these theaters are willingly running the long-lucrative show at a loss \u2014 they are hungry to create, determined to stay visible and eager to satisfy those \u201cChristmas Carol\u201d die-hards who don\u2019t want to miss a year.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely an obligation, in the best sense of that word,\u201d said Curt Columbus, the artistic director of Trinity Repertory Company, in Providence, R.I., which has staged \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d each holiday season since 1977. \u201cThe story felt more urgent, and more necessary, than it has in many years.\u201d</p>\n<p>A primer for those who don\u2019t know a Cratchit from a Fezziwig: \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d is an exceptionally durable novella, written by Charles Dickens and published in 1843, about the transformation, via a series of ghostly visitations, of a wealthy businessman (that\u2019s Scrooge) from mean and miserly to caring and charitable.</p>\n<p>Dickens himself performed readings of the story for more than two decades, with stops in America as well as Britain, until his death in 1870; it has been repeatedly adapted for stage and screen, and the story, in one form or another, has been a seasonal staple of the American regional theater since the 1970s. Last year a critically lauded adaptation from England\u2019s Old Vic theater reached Broadway; this year, it will be livestreamed from its London home, fully staged but audience-free.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018A Christmas Carol\u2019 does everything we talk about when we talk about theater \u2014 it builds community, and it tugs us toward our better selves,\u201d said Joseph Haj, the artistic director of the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, which has staged the story since 1975, last year selling 57,900 tickets to the show. This year, the Guthrie will stream a retelling by four actors; it will cost $10 to watch, and will be free for schools.</p>\n<p>Mr. Haj doesn\u2019t expect to make money on it. Nor does Leda Hoffmann, artistic director of the Contemporary American Theater Company in Columbus, Ohio, which, for $20 per device, will stream a contemporary reimagining with Ebony Scrooge at its center. \u201cThis is very likely a losing proposition, but we\u2019re telling the story because we want to tell it,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>The financial implications are enormous, especially for those that have opted not to charge at all. Ford\u2019s Theater in Washington last year sold $2.5 million worth of tickets to \u201cA Christmas Carol.\u201d This year, it is releasing a free audio version on its website and on public radio, paid for by corporate sponsorships and donations. \u201cHopefully it will come back to us in other ways,\u201d said Paul R. Tetreault, Ford\u2019s director.</p>\n<p>The money \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d usually brings in allows theaters to perform more challenging work at other times of the year.</p>\n<p>In Raleigh, N.C., where Ira David Wood III, the artistic and executive director of Theater in the Park, has been playing Scrooge in a musical adaptation since 1974 (he missed one year, when he had open-heart surgery), the money earned from the holiday show \u201cenables us to do \u2018Uncle Vanya\u2019 and play to maybe 12 people,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Like many major regional theaters, Providence\u2019s Trinity Rep is enormously dependent on the show, which accounts for half of all annual sales. This year, its one-hour streaming version looks still to be popular \u2014 in the first 72 hours, 75,000 people from 46 states signed up to watch. But ticket revenue, which last year topped $1.7 million, will be zero, because the video is being aired for free.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis thing has kept American theaters alive for decades and decades,\u201d said Charles Fee, the producing artistic director of Great Lakes Theater in Cleveland. \u201cWithout \u2018Christmas Carol,\u2019 our company would almost certainly have failed.\u201d</p>\n<p>The 2020 renditions are taking place in every imaginable fashion, although rarely the traditional. Last Tuesday, a prominent regional theater still hoping to stage an indoor production \u2014 the American Shakespeare Center in Virginia \u2014 canceled all live performances and replaced them with digital options, citing the resurgent pandemic. </p>\n<p>Live outdoor productions are requiring social distancing and masks. \u201cObviously we understand the gravity of trying to do something right now, and we\u2019re in a perpetual state of anxiety,\u201d said Christopher Brazelton, the executive director of the Elm Street Cultural Arts Village in Woodstock, Ga., which is planning a short run of an open-air concert version of its annual \u201cChristmas Carol\u201d musical.</p>\n<p>Safety concerns have led several theaters to reconsider the longstanding and crowd-pleasing practice of casting children. To portray Tiny Tim, the disabled child whose fate plays a key role in Scrooge\u2019s awakening, some are now turning to the shortest adult members of their casts. The Lyric Theater of Oklahoma, staging an outdoor production at which patrons walk from musical scene to musical scene across the 10-acre Harn Homestead, is using a puppet so Tiny Tim can be hugged and hoisted without fear.</p>\n<p>Stuart Carden, the artistic director of Kansas City Repertory Theater, explored six \u201cChristmas Carol\u201d options before settling, as local infections increased, on a sort of virtual fireside chat, in which four popular local actors, including one who has played Scrooge for 35 years, tell the story direct to camera, for $65 per household. \u201cWe just knew we had to continue,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>The Alliance Theater in Atlanta is opting for a drive-in \u201clive radio play\u201d in a parking lot across from a college football stadium. Four performers will be ensconced in separate shipping containers, with attendees encouraged to honk their horns, flash lights and sing along with Christmas carols.</p>\n<p>And the St. Louis Shakespeare Festival has enlisted PaintedBlack STL, a coalition of local Black artists, to create scenes from \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d in 21 storefronts around that city\u2019s Central West End; as patrons wander from window to window, scanning a QR code will allow them to listen to the story as sung by the hip-hop Q Brothers Collective. On weekend nights, there will be live performers along the route.</p>\n<h3>\u2018Who\u2019s calling?\u2019</h3>\n<p>The most popular solutions are versions of the new normal \u2014 streaming, in Milwaukee and Houston, for example, and radio, in cities including Chicago, Louisville and San Francisco.</p>\n<p>One particularly inventive example: From its warehouse home in Chicago, Manual Cinema will livestream an original adaptation featuring shadow puppets and murder hornets and a new character, the contrarian Aunt Trudy.</p>\n<p>Here and there are some big ventures. The Tony Award-winning actor Jefferson Mays will tackle 50 different roles in a $3.7 million one-man video version, filmed by a Broadway producer to benefit 71 amateur, community and regional theaters and arts organizations.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why, on a recent rainy Thursday, Mr. Mays found himself several feet above an empty stage in a cavernous Washington Heights theater, grinning and grimacing as a whirring pair of electric fans made his black dressing gown billow and a faraway director shouted out cues.</p>\n<p>\u201cSwim!\u201d instructed the director, Michael Arden. \u201cLook down at the city!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re falling fast!\u201d With each cue, Mr. Mays adjusted his face and his body, writhing in the air as cameras zoomed in. And then, \u201cCut!\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Mays has been perfecting his one-man adaptation for years, and he hoped to frighten, delight and inspire audiences with his version on Broadway. But then the pandemic struck. So instead of an audience, he was playing to a virus-tested, face-masked, socially distanced film crew.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo matter how many times I\u2019ve read it, it hits me in the solar plexus,\u201d he said later, \u201cand these times seem to need it more than ever.\u201d</p>\n<p>One low-tech way to find it: a trip to the mailbox. New Jersey\u2019s McCarter Theater Center is offering $40 gift-wrapped boxes with abridged staves (Dickens-speak for the novella\u2019s sections) as well as cards to prompt conversation, or just to color.</p>\n<p>Sarah Rasmussen, the theater\u2019s artistic director, hopes families will perform and explore the tale themselves. \u201cStorytelling can happen anywhere,\u201d she said.</p>"

                "body": "<p>PATTI LABELLE\u2019S superpower is a spellbinding scream \u2014 a refined shriek, really \u2014 that makes hairs stand at attention, bones shiver and spines twist. It was 1975 when I first heard it. I was 10, in my parents\u2019 South Bronx tenement, where the radio station WBLS \u2014 offering \u201cthe total Black experience in sound,\u201d as the promos said \u2014 was always on during our morning rush to school. That\u2019s when it hit me \u2014 \u201cCreole Lady Marmalaaaaade,\u201d the last word of those titular lyrics, which debuted the year before, filling the air. My first Patti LaBelle moment. There have been many such moments since \u2014 like hearing \u201cLove, Need and Want You\u201d (1983), which I put on the very first slow-jam tape I made as a teen \u2014 and with each one, the only logical reaction is to throw up your hands, kick off your shoes and, on occasion, break out in a praise dance.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no such thing as a passive response to a Patti LaBelle song \u2014 nor should there be. LaBelle came to prominence in the 1970s, a decade that was defined by the greatest generation of divas of soul and gospel music: Aretha Franklin, Diana Ross, Shirley Caesar, Gladys Knight and Inez Andrews, as well as the relative youngsters Chaka Khan and Natalie Cole. But there was something so relatable about LaBelle, who reminded you of your favorite church soloist or the girl at the high school talent show who could saaang, not just sing. LaBelle has been described as the Godmother of Soul, a master of one of America\u2019s classic art forms, but that moniker ultimately fails to capture the singularity of her musical prowess: Perhaps more than any living performer, LaBelle sits at the intersections of soul and gospel, the former a genre that is indebted to the latter. Gospel is a form of Black religious music that emerged in the 1930s courtesy of Thomas A. Dorsey, the onetime pianist for the blues legend Ma Rainey who also wrote the classic \u201cTake My Hand, Precious Lord.\u201d Soul took shape in the 1950s, in large part because of Ray Charles, who added secular lyrics to the melodies of familiar gospel songs, most famously with the track \u201cI Got a Woman\u201d (1954), an early remix of sorts of the Southern Tones\u2019 \u201cIt Must Be Jesus.\u201d Many Black churchgoers considered Charles\u2019s music blasphemous, but he opened a portal to a generation of gospel singers like Sam Cooke, Johnnie Taylor and Franklin, who became early stars of the new genre.</p>\n<p>But LaBelle is more than someone who exhibits a mastery of soul and gospel; she is \u201cchurch,\u201d a style of singing taken from Black Pentecostal and Baptist musical traditions, where gospel music is unfettered by the business of religion and soul is unfettered by expectations of the music industry. LaBelle\u2019s rendition of the ABCs on \u201cSesame Street\u201d in 1998 is just one example. She begins in a slow, bluesy style, accompanied by a piano, and as a congregation of Muppets joins in, the song is transformed into a sanctified shout, performed with a fervor no one had ever had for the ABCs \u2014 and perhaps never will again. It was church.</p>\n<p>IT FELT LIKE the last day of summer on the autumn afternoon that I arrived at LaBelle\u2019s home, just north of Philadelphia \u2014 the whir of her family and staff was not unlike that of children during recess. While Tupac Shakur and Dr. Dre\u2019s \u201cCalifornia Love\u201d played in the background at LaBelle\u2019s request, the photographers Deb Willis and Hank Willis Thomas went about the work of capturing a woman who is beyond simple impressions. Watching them made me think of Roy DeCarava\u2019s classic photos of Ornette Coleman, Billie Holiday or John Coltrane, or Malcolm X taking a photo of Muhammad Ali \u2014 one of the most photographed Black Americans of the 20th century taking pictures of one of the most photographed Black Americans of the 20th century. In other words: an alignment of Black brilliance and genius.</p>\n<p>At 76, the unwieldy rawness of LaBelle\u2019s youthful instrument has given way to a refined and nuanced power that she summons with the aplomb of a master craftswoman. She\u2019s \u201ctruly gotten better,\u201d Dyana Williams, the longtime Philadelphia radio personality and a friend of LaBelle\u2019s, told me. The singer, she added, \u201chas transcended generations and still remained relevant to each generation of music makers.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yet even more significant than her longevity is the context of her staying power. LaBelle is of a generation of Black women who are regularly lauded with the honorific of \u201cauntie\u201d \u2014 Auntie Phylicia, Auntie Gladys, Auntie Cicely \u2014 a term of affection for women who continue to hold an important place in the culture. These are the women who young Black folks know will always offer support without immediate judgment \u2014 who will provide correction and counsel. As I was shown into LaBelle\u2019s living room, the scents of nutmeg and cinnamon hanging in the air \u2014 there was peach cobbler in the oven \u2014 I realized I was no longer in Patti LaBelle\u2019s home but in any number of aunties\u2019 homes, which I\u2019ve come to expect to smell this way. \u201cOh my,\u201d I thought to myself, sitting on the couch across from a piano covered with dozens of photographs of close family and friends, including the Clintons and Barack Obama, \u201cI\u2019m in Auntie Patti\u2019s house.\u201d And then she appeared: stunning, regal, beautiful.</p>\n<p>We later moved to her sitting room, where she keeps a selection of her many awards; she has five certified gold records, the platinum-selling \u201cWinner in You\u201d (1986) and two Grammys, earned for her albums \u201cBurnin\u2019\u201d (1991) and \u201cLive! One Night Only\u201d (1998). LaBelle lives by herself, but the assorted family members in the house that day \u2014 her two young granddaughters, her son Zuri and his wife (who\u2019s also her personal makeup artist), who all live nearby \u2014 were a good indication of how welcoming a space it is: a home, not a way station, an important place for someone who has spent a lifetime on the road (until the recent pandemic, she still toured regularly). \u201cPhiladelphia is a place for me to live all my life because it\u2019s quiet enough for me,\u201d LaBelle said of her hometown. \u201cIt\u2019s not crazy like New York or L.A. I love Philly. Philly is my home.\u201d</p>\n<p>But Philadelphia has also been a musical inspiration for LaBelle and generations of artists from the city and beyond. \u201cIt\u2019s the most productive city I know,\u201d LaBelle said, reeling off a string of artists who were either born in the city or made their reputations there: Bunny Sigler, Thom Bell, Pink, Jill Scott, the Roots, Eve, Musiq Soulchild, her close friend Teddy Pendergrass, Phyllis Hyman, Billy Paul. Philadelphia sits between and thus in the shadows of America\u2019s cultural capital, New York City, and the seat of American power, Washington, D.C. There\u2019s an underdog quality to the place, something that makes its residents try harder than they might. Indeed, when you listen to LaBelle\u2019s vocals on early covers of \u201cOver the Rainbow\u201d (recorded in 1966) or the Irish hymn \u201cDanny Boy\u201d (in 1964) \u2014 the young LaBelle singing as though each note will be her last \u2014 there\u2019s a feeling of \u201cI can\u2019t believe she did that with this song,\u201d trampling all conventions in her range and phrasing, making us rethink how these Tin Pan Alley standards were supposed to be sung. The essence of Patti LaBelle the singer is that she is always willing to do that to a song, and it\u2019s one reason she is the exemplar of what has become known as the Philly Sound.</p>\n<p>And yet, what is that sound? \u201cYou know Philly when you hear it,\u201d LaBelle said coyly. Williams, who\u2019s been based in Philadelphia for the past 40 years, described it as \u201cmelodic, harmonic, rhythmic and funky at the same time \u2014 the embodiment of multiple genres,\u201d including European classical music: The string arrangements you hear in many of the genre\u2019s songs \u2014 like the intro to the O\u2019Jays\u2019 \u201cStairway to Heaven\u201d (1975) or the proto-disco classic \u201cLove Is the Message\u201d (1973) by MFSB \u2014 were often performed by members of the Philadelphia Orchestra. Williams is referencing Philadelphia International Records specifically, the label founded by Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff in 1971 that is synonymous with Philadelphia Soul. The label\u2019s sound married the earthy vocals of local singers with the pop appeal of Motown. Philadelphia Soul was the embodiment of the aspirations of working-class Black Americans who wanted the good life for themselves in the post-civil rights era. At its best, the label balanced those aspirations (the lush strings) with a prideful defiance, emboldened by those signature bass lines, which you can hear on a track like LaBelle\u2019s \u201cLove Bankrupt\u201d (1983). Ostensibly a song about losing love, it\u2019s also a subtle analogy for a retreat from the early gains of the civil rights movement: \u201cYou changed on me,\u201d LaBelle sings, and you can tell she means it.</p>\n<p>BORN PATRICIA HOLTE \u2014 her family called her Patsy \u2014 on May 24, 1944, LaBelle was raised in the Eastwick neighborhood in southwest Philadelphia, a largely Black working-class community, by her parents, Henry and Bertha Holte. She was the second youngest of five children: Her brother, Thomas, was the eldest, and she had three sisters, Vivian, Barbara and Jackie. In her memoir, \u201cDon\u2019t Block the Blessings\u201d (1996), LaBelle recounts a doting father, a railroad man and sometime nightclub performer who braided her hair, cooked her breakfast and had a voice like Nat King Cole. Her mother worked in food service before becoming a full-time homemaker. When her father became abusive toward her mother, the two divorced. On one occasion following her parents\u2019 split, LaBelle was sexually abused by her mother\u2019s new boyfriend. After that, it was the music of Nina Simone, Gloria Lynne, Dakota Staton and James Moody \u2014 introduced to her by her brother \u2014 that became LaBelle\u2019s \u201cescape hatch \u2026 [and] gave me something to believe when I thought I had lost my faith.\u201d She started singing shortly thereafter, with \u201cthe broom as a microphone,\u201d as she recalled. She then moved on to the church choir at Beulah Baptist Church \u2014 which was close to her childhood home \u2014 at a time when the church played a prominent role in the daily lives of Black Americans. It was the choir director, Harriet Chapman, who forced LaBelle to take a solo. \u201c\u2018Oh, no, Patsy, you have to come in front and do the lead,\u2019\u201d LaBelle remembered her saying. When she protested, Chapman suggested a duet with her son, Nathan. LaBelle got the bug quickly thereafter, singing \u201cGod Specializes,\u201d and received the amen from the whole congregation: \u201cThey all stood up saying, \u2018Hallelujah!\u2019 That\u2019s when I first realized I had talent.\u201d</p>\n<h2>The pace of ballads allows LaBelle to explore a range of emotion that speaks so palpably to the lives of everyday folk: Ballads are the comfort food of soul music \u2014 melodies that stick to the bones, sustenance for working-class communities whose very humanity is challenged on a daily basis.</h2>\n<p>LaBelle began her career in 1960 when she joined a quartet that had originally included Jean Brown, Yvonne Hogen and Johnnie Dawson but would later feature the singers Nona Hendryx, Sarah Dash and Cindy Birdsong. (Birdsong would go on to join the Supremes in 1967, making the quartet a trio.) The Ordettes, as they called themselves, signed with Harold Robinson\u2019s Newtown Records label in 1962 and were rechristened the Bluebelles; their lead singer, \u201clittle\u201d Patsy Holte, became Patti LaBelle. But the group was largely overshadowed by others like the Shirelles and the Supremes, the latter of which became one of the most successful groups ever; their lead singer, Diana Ross, became a global superstar. But Ross was never tied to one place like LaBelle \u2014 she moved to Los Angeles in the early 1970s, and later relocated to New York City. LaBelle, on the other hand, remained, becoming synonymous with her hometown. Diana Ross was a pure pop confection; Patti LaBelle is, and has always been, a home-style meal.</p>\n<p>During their early years, the Bluebelles, like many of their peers, made their living on the so-called chitlin\u2019 circuit, a network of clubs and theaters primarily in the eastern and Southern parts of the United States that catered to Black artists and audiences throughout much of the 20th century. Chitlins, short for chitterlings, was a Black American delicacy derived from scraps \u2014 pigs\u2019 intestines \u2014 so the chitlin\u2019 circuit was a metaphor for the leftover opportunities granted to Black performers in segregated America. Yet it was also a story of resilience, as theaters like the Fox in Detroit, the Howard in Washington, D.C., Philadelphia\u2019s own Uptown and, most famously, New York\u2019s Apollo became incubators for Black music. \u201cI\u2019m happy we had a chitlin\u2019 circuit,\u201d LaBelle told me. \u201cIt makes me be a better me.\u201d Those things that have made her better included cross-country drives, because the group couldn\u2019t afford airfare, or surviving on a paltry per diem by buying candy bars, cans of tuna and 10-cent sardines. \u201cI have a pantry full of sardines and tuna,\u201d LaBelle half-joked, noting, \u201cThat\u2019s what I had yesterday, a nice tuna sandwich, and sardines the other night.\u201d She grinned. \u201cOur good Black was good,\u201d she said, again referring to the circuit \u2014 a reminder that Black Americans had long ago established their own criteria of cultural affirmation.</p>\n<p>But not everything on the chitlin\u2019 circuit was \u201cgood.\u201d It was on one such tour that the singer Jackie Wilson attempted to rape her, as LaBelle recounts in her memoir. Such stories about life on the R&B circuit, or the \u201cRough and Black\u201d circuit, as the fictional character James (Thunder) Early describes it in the film \u201cDreamgirls\u201d (2006), rated very little attention in the 1960s. LaBelle\u2019s willingness to share her story about Wilson, who was revered by audiences and whose legendary stage performances were an inspiration for a young Michael Jackson, was especially brave at the time \u2014 20 years before #MeToo \u2014 and highlighted the precarious position of being a young woman, in particular a young Black woman, in the record industry.</p>\n<p>Such experiences inspired the music that the group recorded in the 1970s, as women who were taking control of their image, their bodies and their sexuality. When the Bluebelles transformed into Labelle in 1971, they also redefined the very idea of the girl group. Absent were the bouffants and Bob Mackie gowns that the Supremes made so famous. As the scholar Maureen Mahon writes in her book \u201cBlack Diamond Queens\u201d (2020), Labelle instead emphasized \u201cindividual voices and personalities in vocals, clothing and onstage style.\u201d Girl groups? No, Labelle was about grown-ass Black women who were \u201cbold, brash [and] brazen,\u201d which is how the group\u2019s manager Victoria Wickham imagined them. As LaBelle recalls in her memoir, Wickham believed the trio would be revolutionary: \u201cThree Black women singing about racism, sexism and eroticism.\u201d On their first albums they covered signature songs from the Rolling Stones (\u201cWild Horses\u201d), Gil Scott-Heron (\u201cThe Revolution Will Not Be Televised\u201d), the Who (\u201cWon\u2019t Get Fooled Again\u201d) and Cat Stevens (\u201cMoonshadow\u201d), forcing themselves into a domain dominated by male performers. As Mahon notes, Labelle\u2019s \u201crebellious performance stances, frank engagement with sexuality and adventurous, high-energy music positioned the group to take a place on the rock stage.\u201d And indeed, their styles, which seemed inspired by the Afrofuturism of Sun Ra \u2014 metallic headgear, midriff tops, skintight bottoms, short skirts and full-length boots \u2014 were a blueprint for more popular Black acts at the time like Earth, Wind & Fire and Parliament-Funkadelic.</p>\n<p>It was during this period that LaBelle married her longtime friend and future manager Armstead Edwards, in 1969, giving birth to their son Zuri in 1973. (The couple would later adopt four more children: Stayce and William, LaBelle\u2019s niece and nephew, whom she took in after her sister Jackie\u2019s death in 1989; and Stanley and Dodd, her neighbor\u2019s children, whose mother had also died.) But marriage and motherhood didn\u2019t keep LaBelle from her music. The trio\u2019s biggest success, the now-iconic \u201cLady Marmalade,\u201d came only a year after her son\u2019s birth, with a New Orleans-style swagger that struts like a drunken sailor intent on satiating his desires, if only for the night: \u201cVoulez-vous coucher avec moi, ce soir?\u201d That these desires are being expressed by three women, breaking some unspoken social contract of decorum, is what made the song so provocative \u2014 and an inspiration for women in the burgeoning days of the feminist movement.</p>\n<p>THE GROUP BROKE UP in 1976, and LaBelle emerged as a breakout R&B singer; since her 1977 solo debut, she\u2019s recorded 23 albums. If there\u2019s something that could be called a definitive Patti LaBelle album, it\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m in Love Again\u201d (1983), which produced one of her most successful songs to date as a solo artist, \u201cIf Only You Knew.\u201d Just as LaBelle says that she knows a Philly song when she hears it, audiences know this is a Patti LaBelle song. \u201cIf Only You Knew\u201d is a slow, slow burn \u2014 a certified slow drag, as folks would\u2019ve called it a generation earlier, during those blue-lights-in-the-basement house parties that LaBelle would have come of age attending. At its start, LaBelle sings, \u201cI must have rehearsed my lines / A thousand times\u201d with a level of restraint that betrays what audiences had come to expect from her. But it\u2019s a setup: She lulls her listeners \u2014 the lyrics rendered as gentle coos and soft murmurs \u2014 until the sudden release, when the song turns into what can only be described as fits of ecstasy.</p>\n<p>\u201cPatti LaBelle is a balladeer. I love ballads,\u201d she told me. Among her signatures are \u201cSomebody Loves You\u201d (1991) and \u201cIf You Ask Me To,\u201d a song that made a minor ripple when she first recorded it in 1989 but became a major pop hit when Celine Dion covered it three years later, using the same arrangements, as LaBelle noted. Though she also admitted, \u201cShe sang so good, and we\u2019re friends, so I said, \u2018I\u2019m happy you did it.\u2019\u201d The pace of ballads allows LaBelle to explore a range of emotion that, when mapped onto feelings of desire, betrayal and even eroticism, speaks so palpably to the lives of everyday folk: Ballads are the comfort food of soul music \u2014 melodies that stick to the bones, sustenance for working-class communities whose very humanity is challenged on a daily basis. When LaBelle sings \u201cSomebody Loves You,\u201d it is a reminder that their lives matter.</p>\n<p>Though LaBelle has written songs, she is at heart a stylist, someone who is as known for the songs that were written for her as she is for personalizing songs that were recorded by others. And while there have been many great stylists in the soul and R&B traditions \u2014 Nancy Wilson made a career out of it \u2014 no one takes ownership quite the way LaBelle does. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be careful what you cover,\u201d LaBelle said, noting some of the songs she wanted to sing over the years but decided not to, like Phyllis Hyman\u2019s \u201cOld Friend.\u201d But then there\u2019s \u201cIf You Don\u2019t Know Me by Now.\u201d First recorded in 1972, it was a major pop hit for Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes \u2014 Pendergrass sang lead \u2014 yet it is the best example of a song LaBelle made her own. On the live 1982 recording, she initially sings it straight, but beginning with the first chorus, she extends the notes \u2014 hitting some before and some shortly after they\u2019re expected, and shimmying on others. It is classic soul singing, but it is LaBelle\u2019s range and her ability to personalize the lyrics that take the song elsewhere. Midway through, she breaks into conversation with the audience. She\u2019s letting listeners in, teaching them the lessons of life. The call and response of the exchange is wisdom imparted and messages delivered. With performances like these, LaBelle earned her reputation as a diva \u2014 a term she dismissed, saying, \u201cI\u2019m a round-the-way girl from Philly. I\u2019m not a diva.\u201d</p>\n<p>IT WAS AN auntie showcase this past September when LaBelle and Gladys Knight sat down to do \u201cVerzuz,\u201d a virtual artist battle, conceived by the producers Swizz Beatz and Timbaland and launched on Instagram in the early months of the pandemic. \u201cVerzuz\u201d quickly became a reprieve from Covid-19 lockdown fatigue and a lifeline for artists who couldn\u2019t tour and audiences who weren\u2019t able to gather \u2014 \u201cIt was like doing a concert because I hadn\u2019t worked in seven months onstage,\u201d LaBelle said. Though artists initially appeared remotely, LaBelle and Knight chose to appear together on a soundstage in Philadelphia.</p>\n<p>Generations of viewers were drawn to the \u201cVerzuz\u201d episode with these veterans of soul; it was as if they were sitting across from us at the kitchen table, where so many aunties share secrets. The two dished on lost loves, and peers they would rather not talk about, or to; they knew the words to each other\u2019s songs, and even invited another auntie, Dionne Warwick, onstage to join them in a rendition of \u201cSuperwoman,\u201d a song they first recorded for a Knight album 30 years earlier. \u201cWe have so much great history. We\u2019re the O.G.s. The real girls,\u201d LaBelle recalled of her friendship with Knight of more than 50 years, dating back to their days on the chitlin\u2019 circuit and through moments of tragedy, including the deaths of LaBelle\u2019s three sisters and Knight\u2019s son. \u201cIt was a blessing,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>\u201cA Philly girl,\u201d she called herself, and yet she\u2019s everywhere now. LaBelle turned to acting in 1984, with her performance as Big Mary in \u201cA Soldier\u2019s Story,\u201d followed by her memorable role as Adele Wayne on the hit television show \u201cA Different World\u201d (1987-93), and in 2015, she appeared on \u201cDancing With the Stars.\u201d In 1999, she expanded into cookbooks \u2014 with recipes like Aunt Hattie\u2019s Scrumptious Sweet Tater Bread and Say-My-Name Smothered Chicken and Gravy \u2014 and a line of cakes, pastries and frozen foods called Patti\u2019s Good Life, which is sold at Walmart. \u201cShe\u2019s entrepreneurial in the most amazing way,\u201d Dyana Williams said. \u201cNot very many artists get to do what she\u2019s doing at this age and stage of their careers.\u201d</p>\n<p>LaBelle\u2019s has been a life joyfully lived. \u201cI\u2019m so happy to be the Black woman with the good food,\u201d she said, and it was clear she meant it. And with that, she sent me on my way with a plate of her peach cobbler, just as so many of America\u2019s aunties would have.</p>\n<p>Hair: David Lamar. Makeup: Lona Azami. Manicure: Amanda Nguyen.

                "byline": "By Hugh Eakin",
                "body": "<p>Since its origins in the ninth century, Dadivank Monastery has withstood Seljuk and Mongol invasions, Persian domination, Soviet rule and, this fall, a second brutal war between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Now the majestic stone complex \u2014 which includes two frescoed churches, a bell tower and numerous medieval inscriptions \u2014 faces something that could be even worse: a dangerous peace.</p>\n<p>Perched on a rugged slope west of Nagorno-Karabakh, Dadivank is one of the hundreds of Armenian churches, monuments and carved memorial stones in a disputed region that will come under the control of predominantly Muslim Azerbaijan according to a cease-fire agreement reached this month. Some of those structures \u2014 like the Amaras monastery and the basilica of Tsitsernavank \u2014 date to the earliest centuries of Christianity. For many Armenians, turning over so much of their heritage to a sworn enemy poses a grave new threat, even as the bloodshed has for the moment come to an end.</p>\n<p>Their concern is understandable. Under the cease-fire, hundreds of thousands of Azerbaijanis uprooted by a previous war in the early 1990s will be able to return. In a victory speech on Nov. 25, President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan suggested that Armenians have no historical claims to the region, asserting that the churches belonged to ancient Azerbaijani forebears and had been \u201cArmenianized\u201d in the 19th century.</p>\n<p>Between 1997 and 2006, the Azerbaijani government undertook a devastating campaign against Armenian heritage in Nakhichevan, an Azerbaijani enclave separated from the main part of the country by Armenian territory: Some 89 churches and the thousands of khachkars, or carved memorial stones, of the Djulfa cemetery, the largest medieval Armenian cemetery in the world, were destroyed. And since the recent cease-fire, images circulating on social media suggest that some Armenian monuments and churches in territory newly claimed by Azerbaijan have already been vandalized or defiled.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Armenian forces laid to waste the Azerbaijani town of Agdam in the wake of the previous Nagorno-Karabakh war in the 1990s. The Azerbaijani government has also claimed that mosques and Muslim sites that had been under Armenian control were neglected or desecrated.</p>\n<p>Now, as Azerbaijan takes possession of newly won territories, a longstanding problem acquires special urgency: How can a government be persuaded to care for the heritage of a people that doesn\u2019t fit into its view of the nation?</p>\n<p>In any instance of intercommunal strife, preserving monuments must take a distant second place to saving lives and protecting human welfare. But the fate of cultural sites matters, too, for the prospects of long-term peace.</p>\n<p>Until now, international efforts to protect monuments have overwhelmingly focused on acts of war and terrorist violence. Following the widespread destruction of museums, libraries and artworks during World War II, diplomats drafted the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, which was eventually ratified by more than 130 countries. But the treaty had a significant loophole for \u201cmilitary necessity.\u201d</p>\n<p>Since the Cold War, deliberate attacks on an adversary\u2019s major monuments \u2014 the Croatians\u2019 shelling of the Old Bridge of Mostar, Bosnia, in 1993; the Taliban\u2019s dynamiting of the giant sandstone Buddhas of Bamiyan, Afghanistan, in 2001; the Islamic State\u2019s razing of Yazidi shrines in Iraq in 2014-15 \u2014 have pushed world leaders and international organizations to give more teeth to the existing legal framework.</p>\n<p>In 2002, the International Criminal Court was established to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes \u2014 including, in the case of war crimes, for the intentional destruction of cultural heritage. In 2008, following widespread outrage over the looting and damage to sites in Iraq during the American invasion and occupation, the United States Senate ratified the 1954 Hague Convention.</p>\n<p>More recently, UNESCO, the United Nations\u2019 cultural agency, launched a high-profile campaign to counter what Irina Bokova, a former UNESCO director general, called \u201ccultural cleansing\u201d by \u201cviolent extremists.\u201d In 2016 the I.C.C. convicted a Malian jihadist of war crimes for leading attacks on the 14th-century Djinguereber Mosque and other sites in Timbuktu, Mali.</p>\n<p>That year, several governments called for the creation of \u201can international network of safe havens\u201d to protect cultural property at risk of imminent attack. In 2017, the U.N. Security Council also condemned the destruction of cultural sites by terrorist groups. President Trump\u2019s threat, in January, to target \u201cimportant\u201d cultural sites in Iran caused an uproar, as well as pushback from the Pentagon.</p>\n<p>Yet some of the most systematic destruction in modern times has involved sovereign governments rather than military combatants or extremist groups. China launched a sweeping campaign against Tibetan monasteries, not during the annexation of Tibet in 1950-51, but years later, when the region was firmly under Beijing\u2019s rule. The Turkish government continued to seize or destroy Armenian sites in Eastern Anatolia many decades after the Armenian genocide, including even in recent years.</p>\n<p>Since 2012, the Myanmar military has demolished hundreds of mosques and Islamic schools in Rakhine State \u2014 part of its brutal crackdown on Rohingya Muslims. Satellite evidence suggests that the Chinese authorities have destroyed 8,500 mosques in Xinjiang in the last three years alone.</p>\n<p>Just a few months ago, India\u2019s Hindu-nationalist prime minister, Narendra Modi, laid the cornerstone for a new Hindu temple on the site of the 16th-century Babri Mosque, which was destroyed by a Hindu mob in 1992. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has ordered that two of Istanbul\u2019s most important Byzantine churches \u2014 Chora and Hagia Sophia \u2014 be converted from museums to mosques, raising fears that their extraordinary Christian mosaics might not be cared for.</p>\n<p>But in all of these cases, the United Nations, the United States and its European allies have remained largely mute. UNESCO, which depends on many of the offending governments for funding and support, has shown little interest in intervening. And alliances and prevailing international norms tend to make foreign governments reluctant to interfere with the domestic affairs of other nations during peacetime.</p>\n<p>By contrast, the case of Nagorno-Karabakh, where a hot war has just ended, could provide a rare opportunity.</p>\n<p>As in other post-conflict situations, cultural sites are particularly vulnerable to score-settling attacks. In 1992, Georgian forces destroyed numerous Abkhaz cultural sites in the former Soviet republic of Abkhazia, including the archive containing much of the region\u2019s history; in the five years after Kosovo\u2019s 1998-99 war with Serbia, some 140 Serbian Orthodox churches and monuments in Kosovo were burned or destroyed.</p>\n<p>Yet in the immediate aftermath of war, precisely because a peace effort is underway, foreign governments and international peacekeepers are unusually well-placed to intervene. Unlike during armed conflict, there is also a chance for international mediators and local communities to work together to prevent attacks before the damage is done.</p>\n<p>The historical treasures of Nagorno-Karabakh need not become casualties of the recent war between Armenia and Azerbaijan \u2014 nor drivers of a next one.</p>\n<p>Since antiquity, numerous sites and monuments have successfully passed from the control of one group to another, often across confessional lines. The Pantheon in Rome, one of the greatest pagan temples of antiquity, owes its remarkable survival in part to its adoption by the Catholic Church in the seventh century. After the fall of Constantinople, Mehmed II the Conqueror preserved Hagia Sophia as a mosque. During the Protestant Reformation, Martin Luther opposed the destruction of Catholic art in Germany, even as he sought to stamp out Catholicism.</p>\n<p>In these cases, major buildings or artworks were recognized by their new stewards as having transcendent value, aesthetic or otherwise. Prestige helped determine preservation: As later Catholic chroniclers argued, the Holy See, by converting one of the greatest Roman buildings into a church, had inherited the glory of the ancient world.</p>\n<p>But legions of lesser-known buildings, artworks and sites have also been cared for and maintained across centuries and traditions. Typically, that has been because they spoke to the people living around them, regardless of the identity of their creators.</p>\n<p>During the Syrian civil war, while Western leaders were wringing their hands about Islamic State attacks on Palmyra, the ancient trading city and UNESCO World Heritage site, residents of Idlib, a rebel-controlled city, courageously protected the ancient, pre-Islamic mosaics and structures in their communities. They viewed these artifacts and sites as crucial to their own contemporary Syrian identity.</p>\n<p>In divided Cyprus, a joint cultural-heritage commission of Greek and Turkish Cypriots was created in 2012 to care for endangered monuments on both sides of the island. Funded by the European Union and the U.N. Development Program, the commission has been embraced by both communities for restoring churches as well as mosques and hamams, and ancient aqueducts and fortifications. Following recent arson attacks on mosques in Greek Cypriot territory, the Greek Orthodox community was quick to condemn the assailants.</p>\n<p>In Nagorno-Karabakh, too, cultural reconciliation is still possible. Despite the dismal record of the past three decades, both sides have demonstrated awareness of \u2014 and admiration for \u2014 heritage that is not their own. In 2019, Armenians restored a prominent 19th-century mosque in Shusha (though they pointedly failed to note its previous use by Azerbaijani Muslims). And in his recent address, Mr. Aliyev acknowledged the importance of the region\u2019s churches \u2014 even as he denied their Armenian origin.</p>\n<p>Security must come first. Russia has already deployed peacekeepers at Dadivank Monastery and has pressed Azerbaijan to protect other Armenian monuments now under its control. The European Union should make similar demands as part of its offer of humanitarian aid, as well as insist that Armenians\u2019 access to important churches is assured. The Azerbaijani government, which already has obtained much of what it wanted in the cease-fire, would have a strong incentive to comply.</p>\n<p>But a durable future for Armenian sites \u2014 especially the numerous less known medieval churches and ornate khachkars \u2014 will require direct engagement by Armenians and Azerbaijanis themselves.</p>\n<p>In fact, the two communities have coexisted at many points in the past. Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, was once home to an Armenian population, and there were a number of mosques in Armenia. In the Nagorno-Karabakh region, the strategic town of Shusha, now under Azerbaijani control, has important 19th-century monuments from both nations \u2014 including the distinctive mosque with twin minarets that was controversially restored by the Armenians and a large cathedral, which was damaged by Azerbaijani forces during the recent fighting.</p>\n<p>Despite centuries of regime change, many of the most important monuments in the region, including Dadivank and other early Armenian sites, have endured \u2014 a reminder that the supposedly ancient and intractable differences driving the current conflict are of recent manufacture. Like the beleaguered civilians around them, these buildings need the world\u2019s immediate attention. But their very survival \u2014 like that of the Pantheon or Hagia Sophia \u2014 so far points to a hopeful truth: It is the natural inclination of human beings to preserve; destruction takes special effort and motivation.</p>\n<p>Hugh Eakin, a Brown Foundation Fellow, has reported on endangered cultural heritage for The New York Review of Books and other publications.</p>\n<p>The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

                "body": "<p>The six faded letters are all that remain, and few people notice them. I would never have seen them if a friend hadn\u2019t pointed them out to me while we walked through New Orleans\u2019s French Quarter. I certainly wouldn\u2019t have realized their significance.</p>\n<p>On Chartres Street, above a beautifully arched doorway, is a curious and enigmatic inscription: \u201cCHANGE.\u201d Now part of the facade of the Omni Royal Orleans Hotel, the letters mark the onetime site of the St. Louis Hotel & Exchange, where, under the building\u2019s famed rotunda, enslaved people were once sold.</p>\n<p>All human landscapes are embedded with cultural meaning. And since we rarely consider our constructions as evidence of our priorities, beliefs and behaviors, the testimonies our landscapes offer are more honest than many of the things we intentionally present.</p>\n<p>Our built environment, in other words, is a kind of societal autobiography, writ large.</p>\n<p>Several years ago, I began to photographically document vestiges of racism, oppression and segregation in America\u2019s built and natural environments \u2014 lingering traces that were hidden in plain sight behind a veil of banality.</p>\n<p>Some of the sites I found were unmarked, overlooked and largely forgotten: bricked-over \u201cColored\u201d entrances to movie theaters, or walls built inside restaurants to separate nonwhite customers. Other photographs capture the Black institutions that arose in response to racial segregation: a Negro league stadium in Michigan, a hotel for Black travelers in Mississippi. And a handful of the photographs depict the sites where Black people were attacked, killed or abducted \u2014\u00a0some marked and widely known, some not.</p>\n<p>I called the project Ghosts of Segregation.</p>\n<p>The small side window at Edd\u2019s Drive-In, for example, a restaurant in Pascagoula, Miss., appears to be a drive-up. It was actually a segregated window used in the Jim Crow-era to serve Black customers.</p>\n<p>The locked black double doors aside Seattle\u2019s Moore Theatre might be mistaken for a service entrance. In fact, this was once the \u201cColored\u201d entrance used by nonwhite moviegoers to access the theater\u2019s second balcony.</p>\n<p>These sites surround us, but finding and verifying them requires months of due diligence.</p>\n<p>Many of the places I\u2019ve photographed were found after conducting research online, in person and on location. I have reached out to scholars, historians and ordinary people who might share their insights, experiences and suggestions. Local libraries and museums often guide me to forgotten places. Historical preservation websites and publications such as The Oxford American, The Clarion-Ledger and many other news sources add immeasurably to my understanding.</p>\n<p>In 2018, I was perusing the website for the Seattle Civil Rights & Labor History Project, which led me to a theater company site that mentioned the Moore Theatre\u2019s segregated entrance. Another site, historylink.org, helped confirm the nature of the door and identify its precise location. Google Street View allowed me to get a sense of its relatively current state.</p>\n<p>The very existence of the door shocked me. I had walked past it countless times over the 40 years I\u2019ve lived in Seattle, never giving it a thought. It wasn\u2019t until the summer of 2020 that the tragic nature of this obscure door resonated with the sobering reminder on the marquee.</p>\n<p>After being tipped off by a contributor to a website called Preservation in Mississippi, I verified the history of the window at Edd\u2019s Drive-In with the manager, Becky Hasty, who told me that the owners had retained it as a reminder of the past. \u201cIf we don\u2019t remember where we\u2019ve been,\u201d she said, \u201cwe might get lost again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Slavery is often referred to as America\u2019s \u201coriginal sin.\u201d Its demons still haunt us in the form of segregated housing, education, health care, employment. Through these photographs, I\u2019m trying to preserve the physical evidence of that sin \u2014 because, when the telling traces are erased, the lessons risk being lost.</p>\n<p>Many of the locations I\u2019ve documented have already disappeared. The painted sign for Clark\u2019s Cafe in Huntington, Ore., which trumpeted \u201cALL WHITE HELP,\u201d was destroyed shortly after I photographed it. The Houston Negro Hospital School of Nursing has since been demolished.</p>\n<p>I often wonder: Does such erasure remedy the inequalities and relieve the suffering caused by systemic racism? Or does it facilitate denial and obfuscation?</p>\n<p>A technical note on the images themselves: Each picture in this series is composed of hundreds of separate overlapping photographs, which I later merge together. The technique, commonly referred to as \u201cstitching,\u201d allows me to produce highly detailed and immersive prints.</p>\n<p>The exposures are made from a single vantage point with a camera mounted on a panoramic head, atop a stationary tripod. The structural integrity of the scene is of paramount importance, since the photographs are meant to be precise documentation of erasable evidence. If you were to stand beside me and photograph the scene with your smartphone, our pictures would look similar, though mine would contain greater detail and more nuanced light.</p>\n<p>These photographs are less about the places themselves and more about the people who once populated them. My goal is to heighten awareness, motivate action and spark an honest conversation about the legacy of racial injustice in America.</p>\n<p>The photographs are also a testament to the endurance of the racial inequalities that have plagued American society, projected backward and forward in time.</p>\n<p>The deaths this year of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, among many other Black Americans, prompted a long-overdue national reckoning, spurring one of the largest movements in U.S. history.</p>\n<p>And these pictures prove that if you look carefully enough, you\u2019ll find that the evidence of the structures of segregation \u2014 and the marks of white supremacy \u2014 still surround us, embedded in the landscape of our day-to-day lives.</p>\n<p>Richard Frishman is a photographer based near Seattle.

Biden Jr. has said he hopes to halt construction of the border wall, but the outgoing administration is rushing to complete as much wall as possible in its last weeks in power, dynamiting through some of the border\u2019s most forbidding terrain.</p>\n<p>The breakneck pace at which construction is continuing all but assures that the wall, whatever Mr. Biden decides to do, is here to stay for the foreseeable future, establishing a contentious legacy for Mr. Trump in places that were crucial to his defeat.</p>\n<p>In southeastern Arizona, the continuing political divisiveness around the president\u2019s signature construction project has pitted rancher against rancher and neighbor against neighbor in a state that a Democratic presidential candidate narrowly carried for the first time in decades.</p>\n<p>The region is emerging as one of the Trump administration\u2019s last centers of wall building as blasting crews feverishly tear through the remote Peloncillo Mountains, where ocelots and bighorn sheep roam through woodlands of cottonwoods and sycamores.</p>\n<p>\u201cWildlife corridors, the archaeology and history, that\u2019s all being blasted to oblivion or destroyed already,\u201d said Bill McDonald, 68, a fifth-generation cattleman and former lifelong Republican who voted for Mr. Biden. \u201cTragedy is the word I use to describe it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Even those like Mr. McDonald who loathe the wall are bracing for the possibility that it could endure for decades to come, basing their assessments on signals from Mr. Biden\u2019s transition team.</p>\n<p>While the president-elect has said he will halt new wall construction, other immigration priorities like ending travel bans, accepting more refugees and easing asylum restrictions are eclipsing calls to tear down portions of the wall that already exist.</p>\n<p>Advisers involved with the transition team, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss planning for the incoming administration, rejected the notion that there would be any attempt to dismantle the existing border wall, with one adviser calling the wall a \u201cdistraction.\u201d</p>\n<p>Customs and Border Protection officials are still rushing to meet Mr. Trump\u2019s mandate of 450 miles of new wall construction during his term, nearly doubling the rate of construction since the start of the year. The administration had built 402 miles of wall as of Nov. 13.</p>\n<p>Of that, about 25 miles had no barrier before Mr. Trump took office. The rest replaced much smaller, dilapidated sections of wall, or sections that had only vehicle barriers, which border officials say did not deter migrants crossing on foot.</p>\n<p>Some of the costliest and most invasive construction is unfolding this month in Guadalupe Canyon, an oasis-like habitat for species of birds, like the buff-collared nightjar and tropical kingbird, that are rarely found in the United States.</p>\n<p>Until the blasting crews showed up this year, the canyon was so remote \u2014 about 30 miles outside of Douglas, the closest town, on largely dirt roads \u2014 that ranchers in the area say illegal crossings by migrants were extraordinarily infrequent.</p>\n<p>Now parts of the canyon resemble an open-air mining operation. Work crews are blasting cliff sides on a daily basis to build the wall and access roads to it in one of the costliest portions of construction anywhere on the border.</p>\n<p>Jay Field, a spokesman for the Army Corps of Engineers, cited the canyon\u2019s \u201c4.7 miles of challenging, rugged and steep terrain\u201d in a statement explaining that the cost per mile for this segment is about $41 million, roughly double the border wall\u2019s estimated average cost per mile laid out in a 2020 C.B.P. status report.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t just heartbreaking but totally pointless,\u201d said Diana Hadley, a historian whose family\u2019s ranch includes much of Guadalupe Canyon. She said natural barriers had long served as a deterrent against crossings in the remote area.</p>\n<p>Such critical views of the wall are far from unanimous along this part of the border. One prominent supporter of the wall is the Republican mayor of Douglas, Donald Huish, whose family migrated to the United States from Mexico after the Mexican Revolution.</p>\n<p>\u201cOnce the government does something this big it\u2019s very hard for them to take it back,\u201d said Mr. Huish, adding that he believed that the wall had made the town safer by pushing migrants to cross the border in stretches of desert relatively far from Douglas.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019d reached the saturation point of finding illegal aliens in our back alleys, and now that situation has changed,\u201d Mr. Huish said, citing the impact of both the wall construction now underway and portions of the wall that were built before Mr. Trump took office.</p>\n<p>Another outspoken wall supporter is Belva Klump, 83, whose family has ranched in Arizona\u2019s borderlands for generations.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll I can say about the wall is that I\u2019d like to see more of it,\u201d Ms. Klump said. When asked to expand on what she meant, Ms. Klump used a slur to refer to people who cross the border with Mexico without authorization.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what the wall is good for,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>One of her grandsons, Timmothy Klump, 31, put it another way.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe wall is a common-sense thing that improves our security and keeps my cows from wandering into Mexico,\u201d Mr. Klump said. \u201cThe ranchers opposed to the wall are in the minority.\u201d</p>\n<p>In their remaining time in office, Trump administration officials are promoting the wall while criticizing Mr. Biden\u2019s immigration proposals.</p>\n<p>Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, has said the wall allows the agency to funnel migration into certain areas and strategically deploy agents in places where they can make apprehensions.</p>\n<p>Mr. Morgan said Mr. Biden\u2019s plan to stop construction of the border wall was \u201cgoing to have a dramatic negative impact.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is nothing but politics,\u201d Mr. Morgan said of the continuing controversy over the wall. \u201cIt\u2019s really unfortunate and in fact quite disgusting that our ability to protect the American people is going to be negatively impacted because of politics.\u201d</p>\n<p>The border agency has thus far concentrated construction in areas owned by the federal government, much of it in areas with terrain that already impedes migration, such as some of the stretches of border in Arizona where work crews are blasting. The government has accelerated construction in some of these places by waiving dozens of laws, including measures protecting Native American burial sites and endangered species.</p>\n<p>Rodney Scott, chief of the Border Patrol, said last month that the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, an area with historically high illegal crossings, was a higher priority for the agency. But the construction there has been slow going because the planned path for the wall runs through privately owned land.</p>\n<p>While few miles of border wall have been constructed in South Texas, it has had immense impact on landowners there. The administration has filed more than 117 lawsuits against landowners this year to survey, seize or potentially begin construction on property, an increase from 27 lawsuits filed in 2019, according to the Texas Civil Rights Project.</p>\n<p>Richard Drawe, a 70-year-old landowner in the area near Progreso, Texas, voluntarily signed over his land to the administration to avoid facing the government in court, conceding that the administration could eventually use its eminent domain authority to take the land anyway.</p>\n<p>A year ago, the wall was just a looming presence in the distance. The steel bollards now stretch past his home, cutting him and his wife off from the sunsets and the roseate spoonbills they loved to watch.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m used to living out in the open, no fences, doing what I want to do,\u201d Mr. Drawe said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see a damn wall when I step out the door.\u201d</p>\n<p>But while Mr. Drawe, who voted for Mr. Trump earlier this month, does not want the border wall on his property, he agrees that it will help Border Patrol agents slow illegal migration.</p>\n<p>Brian Hastings, the Customs and Border Protection chief for the Rio Grande Valley sector, said the wall has given the agency more flexibility to strategically place agents in areas that lack barriers or surveillance technology.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe will see the benefits greatly once this wall system is in place without a doubt,\u201d Mr. Hastings said in an interview. \u201cIt allows us to be able to respond quicker.\u201d</p>\n<p>Still, as construction intensifies, some say it is premature to accept the premise that the wall is here to stay.</p>\n<p>Vicki Gaubeca, the director of the Southern Border Communities Coalition, said the next administration could not only halt construction but start taking down some sections, especially those that are harmful to Indigenous traditions or endangered species.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at how destructive the Prohibition era was and how the country moved on,\u201d said Ms. Gaubeca, whose group was part of a coalition that this year won a federal appeals court ruling that the Trump administration did not have the authority to transfer $2.5 billion from the Pentagon for wall construction, sending the matter to the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>\u201cNew leaders,\u201d Ms. Gaubeca said, \u201ccan pivot away from bad ideas.\u201d</p>\n<p>But even if Mr. Biden wants to do so, he could face logistical and financial challenges including the payment of termination fees for canceling some contracts. A single contract in November 2019 for 33 miles of fence replacement in Arizona, currently valued at about $420 million, could cost the government nearly $15 million to terminate, according to ProPublica, which first reported on the fees for altering the contractual agreements.</p>\n<p>If the project is halted, border authorities will also likely need to do further work on the river levee where the wall was planned to be built to ensure it is resistant to flooding and approved by the International Boundary and Water Commission, according to Customs and Border Protection. The wall was part of the flood control plan previously approved by the commission, and portions of the levee have already been altered to prepare for the construction of the border wall.</p>\n<p>While others seem resigned to living in the wall\u2019s shadow, Karen Hesselbach, who lives on another stretch of the border in Arizona near the San Pedro River, sees things differently.</p>\n<p>She said work crews had destroyed the solitude she sought when moving from Maine to the border 23 years ago. Ms. Hesselbach can now gaze at the wall from her front yard.</p>\n<p>Ms. Hesselbach said she had begun likening the border wall, which she despises, to the work of Christo, the Bulgarian-born conceptual artist known for epic-scale environmental projects.</p>\n<p>\u201cI try to look at it as a temporary art installation,\u201d said Ms. Hesselbach, 69, who owns a thrift store in the town of Palominas. \u201cMy hope is it gets torn down.\u201d</p>\n<p>Simon Romero reported from Douglas, and Zolan Kanno-Youngs from Washington.</p>"

                "headline": "What We Learned From Week 12 of the N.F.L. Season",
                "subheadline": "The Titans demolished the Colts, the Chiefs won again and the Broncos, with no quarterback, were crushed in a week defined as much by the coronavirus as the action on the field.",
                "byline": "By Benjamin Hoffman",
                "body": "<p>With the coronavirus sweeping through the N.F.L. at a greater extent than it had all season, Week 12 had an uneasy edge to it, and several teams had to cobble together solutions to problems brought by player absences resulting from positive tests and close contacts. The league soldiered on, however, getting all 12 of Sunday\u2019s games in regardless of the issues. But a Tuesday game in which as many as 20 Ravens players could be out because of a coronavirus outbreak still looms.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what we learned:</p>\n<p>The Titans know how to hammer a weakness. The Colts were dealt quite a blow when defensive tackle DeForest Buckner was ruled out of this game following a positive test for the coronavirus. The massive interior lineman has been a key part of Indianapolis\u2019 stout defense, and without him \u2014 and with Indianapolis missing two other important starters on defense \u2014 the Colts had absolutely no answer for Derrick Henry, who rumbled for 178 yards and three touchdowns. All three of Henry\u2019s touchdowns came in a laugher of a first half in which Tennessee went into the locker room leading by 35-14. The rest of the game was merely a formality.</p>\n<p>With the 45-26 win, the Titans (8-3) took sole possession of first place in the A.F.C. South. They stand a good chance of holding onto that lead, as they face teams with losing records in three of their final five games.</p>\n<p>Denver didn\u2019t stand a chance. Despite not having a quarterback on the roster as a result of Jeff Driskel testing positive for the coronavirus and the team\u2019s three other quarterbacks being ruled out as close contacts, the Broncos were thrown to the wolves against the red-hot New Orleans Saints. Denver running back Phillip Lindsay officially started at quarterback for Denver, but Kendall Hinton, a rookie wide receiver from the team\u2019s practice squad, took the majority of snaps under center despite not having played the position regularly since 2017 \u2014 his third year in college at Wake Forest.</p>\n<p>Hinton, who took the impossible assignment without complaint, completed just 1 of 9 passes for 13 yards, and was intercepted twice. The Broncos lost, 31-3, and are likely wondering why the N.F.L., which has bent over backward to accommodate other teams that had virus-related issues this season, did not find a way to delay the game until a quarterback could be added to their roster.</p>\n<p>You can still see something new in an N.F.L. game. In the third quarter of Carolina\u2019s game against Minnesota, the Panthers\u2019 Jeremy Chinn, a rookie linebacker, scooped up a Kirk Cousins fumble and returned it 17 yards for a touchdown. Carolina\u2019s kickoff resulted in a touchback, and on the first play of the next series, as the broadcast crew attempted to recap Chinn\u2019s previous touchdown, he helped force a Dalvin Cook fumble before picking the ball up and taking it 30 yards for his second score. Chinn became the first player with multiple fumble returns for a touchdown in a game since Fred Evans did it for Chicago in 1948. Chinn is also believed to be the first defensive player in N.F.L. history to score touchdowns on consecutive snaps.</p>\n<p>Somehow that 14-point swing, which resulted in the Panthers leading by 21-10 early in the second half, did not end with a Carolina victory. Minnesota chipped away at the lead and Cousins eventually found Chad Beebe for a 10-yard touchdown pass with just 46 seconds left in the game to secure a shocking 28-27 win at home.</p>\n<p>A game can go sideways on one play. The Raiders were 3-point favorites on the road in Atlanta, but after a slow first half, Las Vegas was trailing the Falcons by 6-3 late in the second quarter. Things seemed to be turning the Raiders\u2019 way when Atlanta\u2019s Younghoe Koo missed a 40-yard field goal attempt wide right. Unfortunately for Las Vegas, safety Dallin Leavitt fell down at the end of the play and rolled into Koo, receiving a somewhat questionable roughing the kicker penalty. Four plays later, Matt Ryan found wide receiver Calvin Ridley for a 4-yard touchdown pass.</p>\n<p>From there the Falcons were off to the races, taking advantage of four more Las Vegas turnovers after an earlier fumble. Atlanta repeatedly found ways to score after Raiders giveaways and walked away with a laughable 43-6 win.</p>\n<p>No one can cover Tyreek Hill. Tampa Bay came into the season thinking its defense could power a deep playoff run, but Hill showed exactly how vulnerable the Buccaneers are to elite speed by burning the team for 203 yards receiving and two touchdowns \u2014 in the first quarter. It was the most receiving yards in a quarter for any player since 2006 and the most receiving yards in a game for a player all season. But Hill wasn\u2019t done and finished the day with 13 catches on 15 targets for 269 yards and three touchdowns as the Chiefs held on to beat the Buccaneers, 27-24.</p>\n<p>In the must-see play of the game, Patrick Mahomes, who increasingly seems assured of winning his second career Most Valuable Player Award, completed a 75-yard touchdown pass to Hill in which the ball traveled more than 60 yards in the air.</p>\n<p>Sam Darnold is not the answer for the Jets. With a 55-yard opening drive that ended in a 38-yard field goal, the winless Jets took a 3-0 lead over the Miami Dolphins. From there, things only went downhill. Darnold, in his first action since Week 8, was far less effective than Joe Flacco had been in his place, leading his team on drives that resulted in six punts, two interceptions, a missed field goal and a turnover on downs in which the ghost of Frank Gore was knocked back for a 1-yard loss on a fourth-and-1 play in the red zone. After that 3-0 start to the game, the Jets lost by 20-3.</p>\n<p>The 0-11 Jets have only one game remaining against a team that currently has a losing record.</p>\n<p>Aaron Rodgers is at the top of his game. Rodgers dominated Chicago by throwing four touchdown passes in a 41-25 victory, and in doing so he reached 50,000 yards passing for his career. In a postgame interview, Rodgers laughed off such feats, saying, \u201cIt means I\u2019ve been playing a long time. Some of those are longevity records.\u201d But it is worth remembering that Rodgers has significant career advantages over Brett Favre, the Hall of Fame quarterback he replaced in Green Bay, in rate-based statistics like touchdown percentage, interception percentage, adjusted net yards per attempt and winning percentage.</p>\n<h2>Sunday\u2019s Top Performers</h2>\n<h3>Top Passer: Patrick Mahomes</h3>\n<p>In a season in which he continually seems to get better, Mahomes has had at least 30 completions and 300 yards passing in four consecutive games \u2014 an N.F.L. record. His 462 yards passing on Sunday were the second-most in his outrageous career, and 229 of them came in the first quarter. He is up to 3,497 yards passing and 30 touchdowns for the season and has thrown just two interceptions.</p>\n<h3>Top Runner: Derrick Henry</h3>\n<p>Because of his size, many people assume Derrick Henry prefers to run inside the tackles, but the Titans\u2019 star running back is equally adept at running to the outside. In Sunday\u2019s dominant effort against Indianapolis, Henry gained 146 of his 178 yards rushing on runs outside the tackles, according to the N.F.L.\u2019s Next Gen Stats database, with all three of Henry\u2019s touchdowns coming on outside runs to the right.</p>\n<h3>Top Receiver: Tyreek Hill</h3>\n<p>Hill\u2019s 269 yards receiving are tied with Del Shofner of the Giants for the 15th most in an N.F.L. game and fell 67 short of Flipper Anderson\u2019s record of 336, which was set for the Los Angeles Rams in 1989. While Calvin Johnson and Julio Jones have each topped 300 in recent years, Anderson\u2019s record has endured.</p>\n<h2>One* Sentence About Sunday\u2019s Games</h2>\n<p>*Except when it takes more.</p>\n<p>Bills 27, Chargers 17 Buffalo\u2019s defense did most of the heavy lifting in this win at home, but Josh Allen threw a 2-yard touchdown pass, and ran in a 3-yard score, giving him 15 career games with both a passing and a rushing touchdown. Allen trails only Cam Newton, who had 20, for the most such games in a player\u2019s first three seasons.</p>\n<p>Chiefs 27, Buccaneers 24 Patrick Mahomes threw for 462 yards and Tyreek Hill had 269 yards receiving, but of all those yards, the last 8 were potentially the most vital as the short pass from Mahomes to Hill with 1 minute 15 seconds remaining gave Kansas City a first down and allowed the team to run out the clock in a game that had been slipping away from them.</p>\n<p>Titans 45, Colts 26 Indianapolis got 295 yards passing from Philip Rivers, and two rushing touchdowns from backup quarterback Jacoby Brissett, but that wasn\u2019t nearly enough to compete with Tennessee, which could have taken the entire second half off on offense and still won.</p>\n<p>49ers 23, Rams 20 Running backs Raheem Mostert and Jeff Wilson returned from injury \u2014 a most welcome sight for San Francisco \u2014 but this upset was powered more by wide receiver Deebo Samuel, who had 11 catches for 133 yards, and defensive tackle Javon Kinlaw, who had a 27-yard pick-6.</p>\n<p>Patriots 20, Cardinals 17 Arizona came into the day averaging 414.3 yards a game, but New England limited the Cardinals to a respectable 298. Kyler Murray was held without a touchdown pass for the first time since Dec. 1, 2019, 14 starts ago.</p>\n<p>Browns 27, Jaguars 25 Florida\u2019s warm weather helped wake up Cleveland\u2019s passing game, with Baker Mayfield throwing for 258 yards and two touchdowns. But the Browns are unlikely to change their run-heavy approach going forward since Mayfield also missed badly on several other potential touchdowns while running back Nick Chubb raced for 144 yards on 19 carries.</p>\n<p>Vikings 28, Panthers 27 In one of the more impressive make-good moments you\u2019ll see, Minnesota wide receiver Chad Beebe muffed the catch on a punt return late in the fourth quarter, letting Carolina extend its lead with a field goal, only to then score the go-ahead touchdown on his team\u2019s ensuing possession.</p>\n<p>Saints 31, Broncos 3 While Denver was limited to 13 yards passing, New Orleans managed just 78 in Taysom Hill\u2019s second career start at quarterback. That will be plenty as long as the Saints\u2019 running game can generate 229 yards and four touchdowns every week.</p>\n<p>Packers 41, Bears 25 It was 41-10 in the third quarter when the Packers decided they had tried long enough and let Chicago do whatever it wanted for the rest of the game. The result was a final score that was far closer than the game ever felt, but it was easy to imagine Green Bay scoring 50 or more points if the team had kept pressing.</p>\n<p>Giants 19, Bengals 17 Despite losing quarterback Daniel Jones to a hamstring injury in the third quarter, Big Blue was able to fight its way past a Joe Burrow-less Cincinnati. Backup quarterback Colt McCoy didn\u2019t do much, but the Giants scored three field goals following Jones\u2019s injury, which was enough to secure the team\u2019s third straight win. The 4-7 Giants are tied with Washington for first place in the N.F.C. East ahead of 3-6-1 Philadelphia\u2019s game on Monday against Seattle.</p>\n<p>Falcons 43, Raiders 6 After the Raiders\u2019 loss last week, much of the talk centered on how well quarterback Derek Carr had played against Kansas City. He turned that narrative on its head by losing three fumbles and throwing a pick-6 in a humiliating loss to Atlanta.</p>\n<p>Dolphins 20, Jets 3 Because of a thumb injury on Tua Tagovailoa\u2019s throwing hand, Ryan Fitzpatrick was forced into a start against one of his many former teams, and he helped get Miami back on track following last week\u2019s loss to Denver by throwing for 257 yards and two touchdowns.</p>"

                "body": "<p>Each week, good news about vaccines or antibody treatments surfaces, offering hope that an end to the pandemic is at hand.</p>\n<p>And yet this holiday season presents a grim reckoning. The United States has reached an appalling milestone: more than one million new coronavirus cases every week. Hospitals in some states are full to bursting. The number of deaths is rising and seems on track to easily surpass the 2,200-a-day average in the spring, when the pandemic was concentrated in the New York metropolitan area.</p>\n<p>Our failure to protect ourselves has caught up to us.</p>\n<p>The nation now must endure a critical period of transition, one that threatens to last far too long, as we set aside justifiable optimism about next spring and confront the dark winter ahead. Some epidemiologists predict that the death toll by March could be close to twice the 250,000 figure that the nation surpassed only last week.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe next three months are going to be just horrible,\u201d said Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University\u2019s School of Public Health and one of two dozen experts interviewed by The New York Times about the near future.</p>\n<p>This juncture, perhaps more than any to date, exposes the deep political divisions that have allowed the pandemic to take root and bloom, and that will determine the depth of the winter ahead. Even as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged Americans to avoid holiday travel and many health officials asked families to cancel big gatherings, more than six million Americans took flights during Thanksgiving week, which is about 40 percent of last year\u2019s air traffic. And President Trump, the one person most capable of altering the trajectory between now and spring, seems unwilling to help his successor do what must be done to save the lives of tens of thousands of Americans.</p>\n<p>President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has assembled excellent advisers and a sensible plan for tackling the pandemic, public health experts said. But Mitchell Warren, the founder of AVAC, an AIDS advocacy group that focuses on several diseases, said Mr. Biden\u2019s hands appeared tied until Inauguration Day on Jan. 20: \u201cThere\u2019s not a ton of power in being president-elect.\u201d</p>\n<h2>A fatal inaction</h2>\n<p>By late December, the first doses of vaccine may be available to Americans, federal officials have said. Priorities are still being set, but vaccinations are expected to go first to health care workers, nursing home residents and others at highest risk. How long it will take to reach younger Americans depends on many factors, including how many vaccines are approved and how fast they can be made.</p>\n<p>In mid-October, I surprised some New York Times readers by shifting from pessimism to optimism, with the epidemic in the United States most likely ending sooner than I expected. Now that at least two vaccines with efficacy greater than 90 percent have emerged, I am even more hopeful about what 2021 holds.</p>\n<p>But even as the medical response to the virus is improving, the politics of public health remain a deeply vexing challenge.</p>\n<p>The regions of the country now among those hit hardest by the virus \u2014 Midwestern and Mountain States and rural counties, including in the Dakotas, Iowa, Nebraska and Wyoming \u2014 are the ones that voted heavily for Mr. Trump in the recent election. The president could help save his millions of supporters by urging them to wear masks, avoid crowds and skip holiday gatherings this year. But that seemed unlikely to occur, many health experts said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is outside of his DNA,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, a preventive medicine specialist at Vanderbilt University medical school. \u201cIt would mean admitting he was wrong and Tony Fauci was right.\u201d</p>\n<p>In a bitter paradox, some experts noted, Mr. Trump could have been the hero of this pandemic. Operation Warp Speed, which his administration announced in May, appears on track to deliver vaccines and therapies in record-breaking time. The United States may well become the first country to bring the virus to heel through pharmaceutical prowess.</p>\n<p>Had Mr. Trump heeded his medical advisers in late spring and adopted measures to curb new infections, the nation could now be on track to exit the epidemic next year with far fewer deaths per capita than many other nations.</p>\n<p>But during his campaign, Mr. Trump rarely mentioned Operation Warp Speed; it has invested more than $12 billion in six vaccines based on three complex new technologies, as well as antibody therapies with nearly unpronounceable names like bamlanivimab.</p>\n<p>Some health experts expressed concern that Mr. Trump might continue to undermine the coronavirus effort after he leaves office, by contradicting and diminishing any measure proposed by Mr. Biden.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe thinking over here,\u201d said Dr. David L. Heyman, a former C.D.C. official who now oversees the Center on Global Health Security at Chatham House in London, \u201cis that he will continue to harass the White House to mobilize his people for 2024 for himself or his daughter or sons.\u201d</p>\n<h2>The fight over masks</h2>\n<p>The antidote to hopelessness is agency, and Americans can protect themselves even without Mr. Trump\u2019s advice by wearing masks and keeping their distance from others.</p>\n<p>Reluctant officials are finally coming around to ordering such measures. The governors of Iowa and New Hampshire issued mask mandates for the first time in mid-November; the governors of Kansas, North Carolina and Hawaii strengthened theirs. But average Americans are sharply divided over masks.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is pretty broad support for mask mandates even among Republicans,\u201d said Martha Louise Lincoln, a medical historian at San Francisco State University. \u201cBut among extreme right-wing voters there\u2019s still a perception that they\u2019re a sign of weakness or a symbol of being duped.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidelines on Nov. 10, advocating more clearly than before that everyone, infected or healthy, should wear a mask.</p>\n<p>Various studies, involving machines puffing fine mists, have shown that high-quality masks can significantly reduce the spread of pathogens between people in conversation.</p>\n<p>And the common-sense evidence that masks work has become overwhelming. Dozens of \u201csuperspreader events\u201d have taken place in venues where most people were not masked \u2014 in bars and restaurants, at summer camps, at funerals, on airplanes, in churches, at choir practice.</p>\n<p>In contrast, none have been known to occur in venues where most people wore masks, such as grocery stores. One well-known C.D.C. study showed that, even in a Springfield, Mo., hair salon where two stylists were infected, not one of the 139 customers whose hair they cut over the course of 10 days caught the disease. A city health order had required that both the stylists and the customers be masked.</p>\n<p>Even in the most dangerous environments \u2014 hospital emergency rooms \u2014 there have been no reported superspreader events since personal protective gear became widely available. (Many individual doctors and nurses have been infected, however; an incident in South Bend, Ind., in which multiple nurses were infected turned out to be related to a wedding.)</p>\n<p>By contrast, the White House, where masks have been shunned, has been the scene of at least one, and possibly more superspreader events.</p>\n<p>A study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington estimated that 130,000 lives could be saved by February if mask use became universal in the United States immediately. Masks can also preserve the economy: A study by Goldman Sachs estimated that universal use would save $1 trillion that may be lost to business shutdowns and medical bills.</p>\n<h2>A new year, and new health advice</h2>\n<p>Mr. Biden has said that he intends to tackle the pandemic from his first full day in office, on Jan. 21. But because coronavirus deaths follow new cases by some weeks, any results of his actions may not be apparent before early spring.</p>\n<p>The experts generally praised the panel of advisers chosen by Mr. Biden, depicting them as reputable scientists who could credibly reach out to many groups hard-hit by the pandemic, including Black and Hispanic Americans.</p>\n<p>But several experts, some of whom spoke anonymously to avoid offending friends and colleagues, said the panel needed different skills and a different kind of balance.</p>\n<p>Some felt that it should have more scientific expertise, and suggested recruiting more vaccinologists, such as Dr. Paul A. Offit of Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, and more epidemiologists, such as Harvard\u2019s Marc Lipsitch and Natalie E. Dean of the University of Florida.</p>\n<p>Others said the panel needed more behavioral scientists adept at fighting rumors, which have been a major obstacle.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re facing extremely complex and poorly understood dynamics around disinformation, conspiratorial theories, paranoia and mistrust,\u201d Dr. Lincoln noted.</p>\n<p>Among the suggested names with those skills were Heidi J. Larson of the Vaccine Confidence Project in London, Carl T. Bergstrom of the University of Washington and Zeynep Tufekci of the University of North Carolina.</p>\n<h2>Latest Updates</h2>\n<p>Others said the panel had too many members tied to the Obama-Biden administration. Dr. Ezekiel J. Emanuel, for example, was an architect of the Affordable Care Act and Dr. Eric Goosby was Mr. Obama\u2019s global AIDS coordinator. To reach Mr. Trump\u2019s base, they said, the panel needs credible Republican experts.</p>\n<p>\u201cOtherwise,\u201d said Dr. Leana Wen, a former Baltimore health commissioner, \u201cthere will be even more of a mistaken perception that this is Democrats and doctors trying to shut down the economy, when actually controlling the virus is key to economic recovery.\u201d</p>\n<p>Experts suggested adding Dr. Bill Frist, a transplant surgeon and former Republican senator, or Dr. Marc K. Siegel, an internist and Fox News opinion writer.</p>\n<p>Mr. Warren suggested consulting marketing experts and recruiting \u201ceveryone from Santa Claus to LeBron James\u201d as trusted spokesmen.</p>\n<p>Another expert suggested adding Dr. Mehmet C. Oz, a heart surgeon and television personality who was criticized for promoting hydroxychloroquine on Fox News (he later relented), and possibly even asking Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson to join, because they are popular with Mr. Trump\u2019s base and might be persuaded to accept science that would save the lives of their own viewers.</p>\n<h2>Mr. Biden\u2019s plan</h2>\n<p>Mr. Biden\u2019s plan for tackling the pandemic is outlined on his website.</p>\n<p>It calls for far more widespread testing, delivered free; a ban on out-of-pocket costs for medical care for the virus; having the military build temporary hospitals if necessary; cooperation with American businesses to create more personal protective gear and ventilators; more food relief for the poor, and other measures.</p>\n<p>Mr. Biden has said he supports a national mask mandate, although his plan calls on governors to impose state ones.</p>\n<p>All the experts interviewed by The Times praised the plan, but several felt it was not aggressive enough. The pandemic is raging so far beyond control, they argued, that it can be contained only with deeply unpopular but necessary measures, such as rigorously enforced mask laws, closing bars and restaurants, requiring regular testing in schools and workplaces, isolating the infected away from their families, prohibiting travel from high-prevalence areas to low ones, and imposing quarantines that are enforced rather than merely requested.</p>\n<p>Many other countries have imposed such measures despite fierce opposition from some citizens, they said, and they have helped.</p>\n<p>\u201cColleges are the Wuhans of this fall surge,\u201d said Dr. Howard Markel, a medical historian at the University of Michigan\u2019s medical school. Universities, he and other experts said, must stop students from going back and forth between their hometowns and college towns, both of which have many vulnerable residents.</p>\n<p>The key to enforcing mask laws, noted Dr. Robert Klitzman, a psychiatrist and bioethicist at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health, is to punish not people but the owners of buildings that ignore restrictions; Quebec, he noted, fines stores $4,500 if customers are unmasked.</p>\n<p>But after a very divisive election, other experts said, it will be hard to get many Americans to cooperate, especially if Mr. Trump encourages resistance.</p>\n<p>Also, there are legal limits on what the federal government can do. American \u201csanitary codes\u201d and quarantine laws are overwhelmingly based on state and local powers, many of which were granted in the 19th century, when epidemics constantly swept the nation\u2019s cities. The federal government\u2019s powers generally extend to interstate matters.</p>\n<p>So, for instance, while the Biden administration could easily make it a federal crime to refuse to wear a mask on a cross-country flight \u2014 or put offenders on the \u201cno fly list\u201d that was created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center \u2014 it probably cannot make every resident of South Dakota wear a mask if Gov. Kristi Noem and the State Legislature oppose the measure. Ms. Noem has said that she will not enforce mask mandates or lockdowns even if Mr. Biden, as president, orders them.</p>\n<h2>The hope for vaccines</h2>\n<p>The health experts interviewed by The Times all expressed excitement that the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were reported to be 95 percent effective with no serious safety problems. On Nov. 23, a third vaccine, from AstraZeneca, also appeared to be effective, although exactly how effective is disputed.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is an amazing feat of science we\u2019ve just seen, to go from a gene sequence on Jan. 10 to a vaccine by Nov. 10,\u201d said Dr. Lawrence Corey, who is harmonizing disparate vaccine trials so their results can be easily compared.</p>\n<p>However, experts still want to read the data, not just what Dr. Offit called \u201cscience by news release.\u201d</p>\n<p>(Pharmaceutical companies often wait until they have publishable data before announcing clinical trial results. But when news is likely to jolt a stock\u2019s price, it is released immediately to reduce the chance of anyone connected to the company engaging in insider trading, or even appearing to.)</p>\n<p>Mr. Biden will inherit the fruits of Operation Warp Speed and oversee their distribution. Members of his transition team, speaking anonymously because they were not authorized to reveal its deliberations, said they were already discussing two sensitive topics: whether to create a secure way for vaccinated individuals to prove they have received both shots, and whether Covid vaccines should ultimately be made mandatory \u2014 either by the federal government, or by state governments, employers, school systems or the like.</p>\n<p>Making vaccines mandatory may be a political struggle, but it is within the scope of American law. In 1905, in a landmark case, Jacobson v. Massachusetts, the Supreme Court upheld the right of a state government to make smallpox vaccination mandatory, on the grounds that it protected the public health \u2014 despite the fact that the crude smallpox vaccines of that era could cause severe side effects in some people.</p>\n<p>It is also within American religious tradition. Virtually every major religion has held that vaccines are permitted, and some even hold that their members are obliged to be vaccinated for the common good.</p>\n<p>Some experts not on the committee were adamant that, once Covid vaccines are proven to be both effective and safe, they should be made obligatory.</p>\n<p>Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health, noted that his institution already has mandatory testing for all students and staff. He said that companies he advises would like to eventually make vaccination mandatory for all employees, but would prefer the government took the lead by requiring them.</p>\n<p>At Dr. Offit\u2019s pediatric hospital, every member must have had all routine vaccines and get an annual flu shot \u2014 or face dismissal.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not optional,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re taking care of children. And yes, down the line, I think vaccination will have to be mandatory. It\u2019s your responsibility as a citizen.\u201d</p>\n<p>The next dozen weeks will be long and painful. But spring is likely to bring highly effective vaccines and a renewed commitment to medical leadership, something that has been missing under Mr. Trump.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe C.D.C. will have to be rebuilt, and its guidelines and the F.D.A.\u2019s have to be promptly re-evaluated,\u201d said Dr. Robert L. Murphy, director of the Institute for Global Health at Northwestern University\u2019s medical school. \u201cThe Biden team will move quickly. It\u2019s not like they don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]</p>"

But a Times investigation found that faulty guidance and bureaucratic delays rendered the toll far worse than it had to be.</p>\n<p>BERGAMO, Italy \u2014 When Franco Orlandi, a usually hale former truck driver, arrived in mid-February with a cough and fever at an emergency room in the northern Italian province of Bergamo, doctors determined that he had a flu and sent him home. Two days later, an ambulance brought the 83-year-old back. He couldn\u2019t breathe.</p>\n<p>Italy had not recorded a single domestic coronavirus case, but Mr. Orlandi\u2019s symptoms puzzled Monica Avogadri, the 55-year-old anesthesiologist who treated him at Pesenti Fenaroli Hospital. She didn\u2019t test him for the virus because Italian protocols, adopted from the World Health Organization, recommended testing only people with a link to China, where the outbreak had originated.</p>\n<p>When she asked whether Mr. Orlandi had a connection to China, his wife seemed befuddled. They hardly ever ventured beyond their local cafe, Patty\u2019s Bar.</p>\n<p>\u2018\u2018China?\u201d Dr. Avogadri recalled Mr. Orlandi\u2019s wife responding. \u201cShe didn\u2019t even know where it was.\u201d</p>\n<p>What Dr. Avogadri did not know was that Covid-19 had already arrived in her region of Lombardy, a discovery made five days later by another doctor in nearby Lodi who broke the national testing protocol. By then, Dr. Avogadri, hamstrung by those same protocols, had herself fallen ill after days caring for Mr. Orlandi and other patients. Her hospital, rather than identifying and treating the disease, was accelerating its spread across Italy\u2019s economic heartland.</p>\n<p>Bergamo became one of the deadliest killing fields for the virus in the Western world, a place marked by inconceivable suffering and a dreadful soundtrack of ambulance sirens as emergency medical workers peeled parents away from children, husbands from wives, grandparents from their families.</p>\n<p>Hospitals became makeshift morgues and produced parades of coffins and scenes of devastation that became a warning to officials in other Western countries of how the virus could rapidly overwhelm health systems and turn infirmaries into incubators.</p>\n<p>Officials confirmed that more than 3,300 people died with the virus in Bergamo, though they said the actual toll was probably double that. Mr. Orlandi\u2019s town, Nembro, became perhaps Italy\u2019s hardest struck, with an 850 percent increase in deaths in March. So many, the local priest ordered a stop to the incessant tolling of the bells for the dead.</p>\n<p>The question of how such a tragedy could unfold in Bergamo, a wealthy, well-educated province of just more than a million, with top-level hospitals, has remained an uneasy mystery, a blood stain that the government prefers to avoid as it points with pride to Italy\u2019s success in flattening the first wave of infections.</p>\n<p>The World Health Organization\u2019s guidance on testing engendered a misplaced sense of security and helped blind doctors to the spread of the virus. But missteps and inaction after Covid-19 exploded into view aggravated the situation and cost Bergamo \u2014 and Italy \u2014 precious time when minutes mattered most.</p>\n<p>The director of Pesenti Fenaroli Hospital closed its doors almost as soon as he realized he had an outbreak. But regional officials ordered them opened hours later. Hospital workers, visitors and discharged patients were exposed to the virus, and then moved through the province.</p>\n<p>For days, there was an expectation that the national government would lock down towns in Bergamo, as it had earlier done immediately and decisively in Lodi. Some mayors in Bergamo waited anxiously for the police to seal the borders, even as many business and local leaders expressed reluctance.</p>\n<p>Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, publicly turned to a committee of scientific advisers, which formally proposed that he follow the example of Lodi and shut down the newly infected towns in Bergamo. Privately, though, national business lobbies urged him not to close the area\u2019s factories.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, after critical days filled with bureaucratic dithering, as well as spats between Rome and the regional authorities, the government decided the time to save Bergamo had passed.</p>\n<p>With the virus out of control in the province and clusters emerging all around it, the government waited longer but then went bigger. Two weeks after Mr. Orlandi had tested positive, Italy locked down the whole region. Then the country. But Bergamo was lost.</p>\n<h2>Misdirected Doctors</h2>\n<p>Now that the coronavirus, deep into its second wave, has washed across the globe and left virtually no nation untouched, it is easy to forget how alone among Western democracies Italy was in February, confronted with a threat for which it had no playbook.</p>\n<p>Throughout flu season, some local family doctors in the Lombardy region had noticed strange pneumonia cases and were prescribing more scans than usual. The region has business ties to China, and local infectious disease doctors had kept an eye on the coronavirus outbreak in the city of Wuhan. They also trusted Italy\u2019s new and narrower protocols, adopted from the W.H.O. at the end of January, which essentially limited testing to people linked to China.</p>\n<p>But hardly any of the pneumonia patients had such a link, which meant that the few people being tested were mostly air travelers. All had come back negative.</p>\n<p>Then, on Feb. 20, Annalisa Malara, a doctor in the town of Codogno, in Lodi province, decided to break the protocol and test a 38-year-old man with serious pneumonia who was not responding to standard treatments. The man\u2019s test came back positive that same evening and he became Italy\u2019s first known locally transmitted case of Covid-19.</p>\n<p>Two days later, on the outskirts of Rome, an emergency meeting was held at Italy\u2019s Civil Protection Agency, the national disaster relief body. Crammed into a small conference room, Mr. Conte sat at the head of an oval table, surrounded by his ministers, as Italy\u2019s health minister, Roberto Speranza, proposed a dramatic lockdown of towns in the Lodi area.</p>\n<p>The ministers, exchanging nervous looks, unanimously agreed and the government dispatched Italy\u2019s police and army to seal the borders on Feb. 23 \u2014 a decision that it cites to this day as the metric of its boldness and willingness to put Italy\u2019s public health over its economy.</p>\n<p>Mr. Speranza weighed the momentous decision carefully, deciding it was better to err on the side of caution.</p>\n<p>\u2018\u2018I was playing with the lives of people,\u201d he said, adding that in the story of the pandemic, \u201cIt was the first time in the history of Western countries that we were locking down and taking away the freedom of the people.\u201d</p>\n<h2>\u2018We Were Screwed\u2019</h2>\n<p>The discovery of the virus in Lodi, just 60 miles from Bergamo, struck Dr. Avogadri, sick in bed at home, with the force of a revelation.</p>\n<p>She picked up the phone on Feb. 21 and called her colleagues at Pesenti Fenaroli, in the town of Alzano Lombardo in Bergamo\u2019s industrial and densely populated Serio river valley. She urged them to test her patient, Mr. Orlandi.</p>\n<p>At first, they ridiculed her, noting that he\u2019d never been anywhere near China. But other patients on the same floor were deteriorating, and another man with suspicious symptoms soon arrived in the emergency room. Hospital officials decided to swab test him and one of Mr. Orlandi\u2019s roommates.</p>\n<p>By midday on Feb. 23, the results were brought to Dr. Giuseppe Marzulli, the hospital director. Both tests were positive.</p>\n<p>Dr. Marzulli grilled the reporting doctor about whether the staff had adequately investigated connections to China. They had. There weren\u2019t any. The virus was already circulating in their midst.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was at that moment I understood we were screwed,\u201d Dr. Marzulli said. \u201cWe had looked for who had been in China, and this was the tragic error.\u201d</p>\n<p>They swabbed Mr. Orlandi that day, as members of his family moved through crowded corridors of the third floor.</p>\n<p>Some visitors noticed staff members coughing.</p>\n<p>Given the government\u2019s swift action in Lodi, Dr. Marzulli began to prepare for a lockdown. He canceled shift changes so that no new personnel would come in, and he closed the emergency room, mindful that the hospital had only about a dozen swabs to perform coronavirus tests.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t have swabs. It was the biggest problem we had,\u201d he said. </p>\n<p>Hours later, the region and the Bergamo hospital network overseeing Pesenti Fenaroli decided together to reopen the emergency room over Dr. Marzulli\u2019s objections.</p>\n<p>Aida Andreassi, a senior Lombardy health official, said the emergency room had been sanitized and the hospital represented an \u201cindispensable garrison\u201d for a region that needed all its medical facilities.</p>\n<p>But without enough swabs, Dr. Marzulli said, the hospital was defenseless.</p>\n<p>On Feb. 24, Mr. Orlandi\u2019s test results came back. He was positive, too. By then, about 50 more patients had arrived at the emergency room with symptoms, quickly burning through the hospital\u2019s stock of swabs, Dr. Marzulli said.</p>\n<p>A doctor, who tested Dr. Avogadri with one of the available swabs, pressed hospital officials for more tests, reminding them in a frantic email that they had \u201csymptomatic colleagues who have not been swabbed.\u201d</p>\n<p>His superiors pleaded with another hospital in the region for 100 swabs, according to email correspondence seen by The New York Times. But Dr. Marzulli said only half of them made it to Pesenti Fenaroli, on Feb. 26.</p>\n<p>He scrambled, separating patients with symptoms from those without, and sending home visibly sick staff members. But many patients who came in contact with the virus stayed put, while their nurses and doctors kept circulating.</p>\n<p>On Feb. 27, documents provided by Lombardy show, the region sent hundreds more swabs to the Bergamo hospitals. But they didn\u2019t arrive at Pesenti Fenaroli right away, Dr. Marzulli said.</p>\n<p>He was forced to ration out a couple dozen swabs a day until March 1, when he himself fainted from exhaustion with the virus.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf we have to identify a spark,\u201d Giorgio Gori, the mayor of Bergamo city said as infections devastated his town, \u201cit was the hospital.\u201d</p>\n<h2>Ten Days of Indecision</h2>\n<p>The small towns around the hospital increasingly became central to a drama playing out between Bergamo and Rome.</p>\n<p>On Feb. 25, Bergamo province reported just 18 cases compared to 125 in Lodi. Lombardy\u2019s top health official expressed concern about contagion at Pesenti Fenaroli Hospital but said, \u201cIt\u2019s early to say if it\u2019s another cluster.\u201d</p>\n<p>In Rome, Mr. Conte discouraged expanding testing, reasoning that health officials had to follow international protocols, \u201cotherwise we would end up dramatizing\u201d the emergency.</p>\n<p>On Feb. 26, with 20 reported cases in Bergamo, Rome\u2019s scientific committee said it didn\u2019t see any flare-ups that required a lockdown. Claudio Cancelli, the mayor of Nembro, said Bergamo\u2019s health officials threatened to cut off funding to the area\u2019s 18 mayors if they closed centers for the elderly or disabled.</p>\n<p>The next day, he said, they assured the mayors, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. There is no red zone foreseen.\u201d</p>\n<p>But on Feb. 28, Bergamo\u2019s caseload had jumped to 103, against 182 in Lodi. At a Lombardy regional news conference, leading doctors identified the Pesenti Fenaroli Hospital as the outbreak\u2019s source.</p>\n<p>Confindustria Bergamo, the province\u2019s industrial association, responded that same day by posting a video titled, \u201cBergamo Is Running.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCurrent health warnings from Italian government officials are that the risk of infection is low,\u201d the narrator stated. The images showed factories humming.</p>\n<p>That message resonated with Simona Ghilardi, who ran a national transport and logistics company in Nembro, about a mile from Pesenti Fenaroli Hospital. Colleagues in locked-down Lodi had told her about losing clients. Stopping industry in Bergamo was unthinkable to her.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you are born here the first thing they tell you is \u2014 you have to work,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>As talk of a lockdown persisted, she looked out onto her vast warehouse filled with stacks of grocery store circulars, bags of chemical products and crates of detergent to ship to China. \u201cThe factory has to survive too,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>Business leaders, and even the Alzano Lombardo mayor, resisted a lockdown, telling the local newspaper that it would be a tragedy for the economy and contacting their commercial associations with influence in Rome.</p>\n<p>In the capital, Mr. Conte stressed that he would be guided by science alone. He declined interview requests for this article but has denied ever receiving requests from Confindustria as his government weighed what to do in Bergamo.</p>\n<p>The powerful industrial group\u2019s own representatives said they made their requests clear.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere was a direct line between Confindustria and the government at that time,\u201d said Licia Mattioli, who was then the group\u2019s vice president.</p>\n<p>The leadership argued directly to Mr. Conte that the rapid lockdown of the factories in Lodi unnecessarily cost jobs and that in Bergamo\u2019s factories steps like social distancing would be sufficient.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat they were saying was that to stop all the industry, also locally, is really very, very dangerous,\u201d she recalled.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if they understood,\u201d she said of Mr. Conte and his ministers. \u201cBut they listened at least.\u201d</p>\n<p>The factories stayed open until late March, and many never closed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can assure you that never, never, never we made considerations on this,\u201d said Mr. Speranza, the health minister. \u201cWe decided since the beginning that the first point is health \u2014 everything else comes after.\u201d</p>\n<p>On March 3, the government\u2019s scientific committee proposed a red zone around Nembro and Alzano Lombardo. The Lombardy authorities considered it a done deal. So did Mr. Cancelli, the Nembro mayor, who was now infected and working in isolation.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis place should have been closed in February, when it became clear that there were officially declared cases in the hospital, that surely were in contact with health workers, relatives, other patients,\u201d Mr. Cancelli said. \u201cOn March 3 we thought, \u2018Now they will close tonight.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>But Mr. Conte, who needed to approve the decision, has said that he didn\u2019t hear of the plan for two more days.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Mr. Speranza said, he pressed the scientific committee for a report on their rationale for closing the towns. \u201cThey said only \u2018Close,\u2019\u201d Mr. Speranza said. \u201cYou can\u2019t say, \u2018I take away the freedom of people,\u2019 for two words.\u201d</p>\n<h3>The Coronavirus Outbreak \u203a</h3>\n<h4>Words to Know About Testing</h4>\n<p>Confused by the terms about coronavirus testing? Let us help:</p>\n<p>The interior ministry notified Bergamo\u2019s military police to begin preparations for a lockdown, according to Col. Paolo Storoni, then the head of the Carabinieri in the area. Carmen Arzuffi, the owner of Hotel Continental, said the local police prefect called on March 4 to book 50 rooms for 100 incoming officers.</p>\n<p>On March 5, the scientific committee again urged the government to lock down the towns. Mr. Speranza said he sent Mr. Conte the report that night. A member of Parliament from Bergamo privately pressed Mr. Conte\u2019s office about what was taking so long, arguing that a human catastrophe was unfolding.</p>\n<p>Mr. Conte\u2019s office replied, according to correspondence seen by The Times, that there would be a ministerial-level meeting on Saturday, two days later, and that no decision would come before then.</p>\n<p>By March 6, law enforcement had begun setting up at the hotel.</p>\n<p>The police filled the hours by inspecting the routes they were supposed to close off and holding briefings in the basement, with commanders drawing maps of the towns and their streets on an easel.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey knew it all by heart,\u201d Ms. Arzuffi, the hotel owner, said.</p>\n<p>As they ran drills, Mr. Conte met on March 6 with the scientific committee in Rome yet again. According to Mr. Speranza, the committee told Mr. Conte that closing Bergamo was no longer the issue. All of Lombardy, including Milan, needed to be locked down.</p>\n<p>Two days later, on March 8, Mr. Conte did just that.</p>\n<p>Mr. Conte has portrayed himself as urging the scientists to think bigger and bolder, saying he told them, \u201cShouldn\u2019t we think of more radical measures?\u201d</p>\n<p>Later that day, the police officers at the Hotel Continental packed up and left.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing happened,\u201d Mr. Cancelli said.</p>\n<h2>The Virus Preyed</h2>\n<p>As the authorities decided what to do, the virus seemed to spread everywhere and touch everyone. Infections ravaged homes and apartments. People started dying.</p>\n<p>Mr. Orlandi, the burly truck driver who had once delighted the children in his family by thumb wrestling them with his gaping hands, died the day after his family learned he had contracted the virus. Some of his family became infected and died, too.</p>\n<p>Giuseppa Nembrini, 82, and Giovanni Morotti, 85, a married couple in two separate rooms down the hall from Mr. Orlandi, both died.</p>\n<p>Angiolina Cavalli, 84, a patient across the hall, died as well. Her husband, Gianfranco Zambonelli, 85, who had visited the hospital, died of the virus, too.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey never told us anything,\u201d Francesco Zambonelli, their son, who also contracted the virus, said of the hospital. \u201cI think without knowing it, we became a vehicle for contagion to others.\u201d</p>\n<p>Some of the sick included Bergamo soccer fans, 40,000 of whom had commuted to Milan on Feb. 19 to cheer for their local team, Atalanta, in a Champions League match against the Spanish team Valencia.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe were stuck one next to the other,\u201d recalled Matteo Doneda, 49, a rabid fan of Atalanta, who sang at the game, \u201cYou\u2019ll know when we do damage! We are Bergamaschi, and we know no limits!\u201d</p>\n<p>On Feb. 26, Mr. Doneda said cookies began \u201ctasting like sand\u201d and his wife drove him to a hospital. He could barely walk and soon found himself breathing from within an oxygen helmet, surrounded by elderly people gasping for air. He said some of them had broken jaws under their masks, from fainting and falling in the ward.</p>\n<p>Dr. Avogadri declined and lost consciousness, eventually drifting into a semi-comatose state in an intensive care ward, as she lost half of her hair. \u201cI wanted to die,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>When she was finally discharged, she discovered that the doctor who managed to find her a swab at Pesenti Fenaroli Hospital had died and that her older sister, who lived nearby, lay in an intensive care unit, a breathing tube down her throat.</p>\n<h2>No One to Blame</h2>\n<p>All the authorities involved now recognize Bergamo\u2019s losses as a tragedy. But invariably they lay blame for it elsewhere.</p>\n<p>The World Health Organization says that it limited its case definitions for practical reasons, primarily not to waste resources at the outset of an uncertain contagion. The rationale, said Dr. Margaret Harris, a spokeswoman for the organization, was \u201cto limit the testing to a specific population at risk.\u201d It is a position that past W.H.O. officials considered reasonable.</p>\n<p>But Dr. Harris also argued that when the agency updated the guidelines at the end of January, it made clear \u201cthat the patient\u2019s doctor is the one, ultimately, to decide who to test.\u201d</p>\n<p>Doctors in Bergamo considered that a convenient caveat.</p>\n<p>The guidance was \u201cthe thing that generated the huge problem of the spread of the pandemic,\u201d Dr. Avogadri said. \u201cIt was a big limitation.\u201d</p>\n<p>The W.H.O. \u201cmade a mistake,\u201d said Giuseppe Ruocco, Italy\u2019s chief medical officer and a senior official in its health ministry, adding that if Italy hadn\u2019t automatically followed the organization\u2019s lead it \u201ccould have certainly avoided cases and the infection of medical staff.\u201d</p>\n<p>In June, Italy bestowed a knighthood in the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic on Dr. Malara, the physician who exposed the outbreak by disregarding the protocol.</p>\n<p>Local officials and bereaved families in Nembro and Alzano Lombardo argue that closing the towns in February would have slowed the spread. A local prosecutor is investigating what happened and what didn\u2019t happen and why.</p>\n<p>But the government would prefer to focus on its closing of Lodi and then the region.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s two small towns that everyone now knows,\u201d Mr. Speranza, the health minister, said when asked how it was possible the prime minister didn\u2019t know for three days about the shutdown proposal in Bergamo. \u201cBut it\u2019s two small towns.\u201d</p>\n<p>And Mr. Conte has dismissed questions about the boldness of his decision making.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere was no delay,\u201d he has insisted.</p>\n<h2>A Province Gutted</h2>\n<p>Today Bergamo is a province gutted by loss.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, the Rev. Matteo Cella, who performed many abbreviated funeral rites for families he knew, greeted widows and widowers, sons and daughters, nieces and nephews on the Day of the Dead.</p>\n<p>Wearing blue surgical masks, they leaned against the gravestones of their loved ones, or alongside the wood crosses of the unfinished graves of coronavirus victims.</p>\n<p>Father Cella and other prelates read the names of the 231 people who had died in Nembro since the previous November. At least 188 had succumbed to Covid-19. They read the name of Mr. Orlandi, and of the other patients and doctors and visitors with whom he shared the third floor of the hospital during his final days.</p>\n<p>As the mourners followed the priests in prayers, some wandered to the mausoleum wall at the back of the cemetery. Familiar names filled the wall.</p>\n<p>\u201cFranco Orlandi,\u201d read one. \u201c1-3-1936 \u2013 25-2-2020.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s still astonishing,\u201d said Luigia Provese, 81, who drank coffee at the same bar as Mr. Orlandi and said that three of the four people she played cards with had died from the virus. \u201cThese are all people I know.\u201d</p>\n<p>As the virus has exploded again throughout Italy, Bergamo\u2019s massive infection rate during the first wave, doctors say, has given it a measure of immunity. Its hospitals, once an exporter of infection and the sick, are taking patients in from the surrounding areas.</p>\n<p>On Nov. 2, Bergamo\u2019s fairgrounds debuted as a newly converted intensive therapy ward. Dozens of beds radiated wires. Ventilators stood on standby. A team of nurses in hazmat gear huddled for a briefing about reserve oxygen tanks.</p>\n<p>Their coordinator, Lauretta Rota, 56, looked on in disbelief.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt took some time to believe this was happening all over again,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is an emotional and physical exhaustion that comes with that knowledge of what we have to face.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her cellphone rang.</p>\n<p>\u201cOK,\u201d she said, excusing herself. \u201cThe first patient is on the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Emma Bubola contributed reporting from Bergamo and Rome.</p>"

                "body": "<p>NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The viral pandemic is accelerating a transformation of America\u2019s holiday shopping season. </p>\n<p>Few people showed up at the mall this weekend, with millions of pandemic-wary shoppers staying home to shop online. </p>\n<p>The result? Overall holiday sales are projected to rise a slight 0.9% in November and December \u2014 and even that modest gain will be due to an explosion in online shopping, according to the research firm eMarketer. It expects online sales to jump nearly 36%, while sales at physical stores fall 4.7%. </p>\n<p>The online rush was on fully display Monday, known as Cyber Monday, a day of sales promoted by retailers back in 2005. Once the final numbers are tallied up, this year\u2019s Cyber Monday is projected to become the biggest online shopping day in American history.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how this holiday shopping season is shaping up:</p>\n<p>\u201cBLEAK FRIDAY\u201d</p>\n<p>Black Friday, typically the frenzied kick-off of the holiday shopping season, was eerily quiet this year. Health officials had warned shoppers to stay home, and stores followed suit by putting their best deals online to discourage crowds.</p>\n<p>Half as many people shopped inside stores this Black Friday than last year, according to retail data company Sensormatic Solutions.</p>\n<p>\u201cBlack Friday was really Bleak Friday,\u201d says David Bassuk, a member of the retail practice at the consulting firm AlixPartners.</p>\n<p>Online was a decidedly different story. Sales hit a record $9 billion on Black Friday \u2014 up a sharp 22% from last year, according to Adobe Analytics, which tracks online shopping.</p>\n<p>CYBER MONDAY STILL ON TOP</p>\n<p>Even though shoppers had access to weeks of online deals, many held out for bargains that they could get only on Cyber Monday, the Monday after Thanksgiving. </p>\n<p>Amazon offered 30% off on board games and discounts on many of its gadgets. Target had 40% off Legos and robot vacuums for $75 off.</p>\n<p>Cyber Monday is expected to generate as much as $12.7 billion in sales \u2014 a 35% jump from a year ago, according to Adobe Analytics.</p>\n<p>SHIPPING SLOWDOWN</p>\n<p>A big unknown hanging over the shopping season is this: Will retailers and shippers be able to deliver all those online orders in time for Christmas? Retailers have been warning shoppers to buy early this year, because with far more people shopping online during the pandemic, shippers may become overwhelmed with packages to deliver. </p>\n<p>Prolonged delays could send people back to physical stores closer to Christmas, if many people eventually decide that old-fashioned stores are a more reliable way to obtain their gifts on time, said Charlie O\u2019Shea, a retail analyst at Moody\u2019s.</p>\n<p>MORE CURBSIDE PICKUP</p>\n<p>Curbside pickup, in which people order online and pick up at a store\u2019s parking lot, is becoming a popular option for those who want their gifts right away or who fear that they won\u2019t be shipped on time. </p>\n<p>Some stores, like Macy\u2019s, are offering curbside pickup for the first time this holiday. Others are making more space in their parking lots for people to park and pick up orders.</p>\n<p>In the weekend after Thanksgiving, curbside pickup rose 67% from a year ago, according to Adobe Analytics. </p>\n<p>ONLINE SMALL BUSINESSES GAIN, TOO</p>\n<p>While retail giants Amazon and Walmart are likely to be the biggest winners this holiday season, smaller businesses that have an online presence are racking up sales, too.</p>\n<p>Adobe Analytics says online sales at smaller retailers were up 349% on Thanksgiving and Black Friday. And at the more than 1 million businesses that use Shopify to build their websites, sales rose 75% from a year ago to $2.4 billion on Black Friday, according to Shopify.</p>\n<p>Some shoppers are purposefully skipping big stores for smaller ones. </p>\n<p>Bernadette Vielhaber, a technical writer in Avon, Ohio, says she bought books, T-shirts and other gifts from small businesses online, instead of giving her money to large companies that she feels don\u2019t need it, like Amazon. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to be more supportive of people who are struggling to keep their businesses open,\u201d she says. </p>"

(AP) \u2014 President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s pick to lead the Office of Management and Budget is quickly emerging as a political battle that could disrupt his efforts to swiftly fill out his administration.</p>\n<p>Some Republicans are expressing doubt that Neera Tanden could be confirmed by the Senate after she spent years attacking GOP lawmakers on social media \u2014 and many panned the choice.</p>\n<p>Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton claimed Tanden\u2019s rhetoric was \u201cFilled with hate & guided by the woke left.\u201d</p>\n<p>Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn said Tanden\u2019s \u201ccombative and insulting comments\u201d about Republican senators created \u201ccertainly a problematic path.\u201d He called her \u201cmaybe (Biden\u2019s) worst nominee so far\u201d and \u201cradioactive.\u201d</p>\n<p>Potential Budget Committee Chair Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., was less hostile, telling reporters, \u201cLet\u2019s see what happens.\u201d Moderate Susan Collins, R-Maine, a target of Tanden\u2019s, said, \u201cI do not know her or much about her, but I\u2019ve heard she\u2019s a very prolific user of Twitter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Such sentiment is notable considering the GOP\u2019s general reluctance to criticize President Donald Trump\u2019s broadsides on Twitter. But like all of Biden\u2019s nominees, Tanden has little margin for error as she faces confirmation in a closely divided Senate.</p>\n<p>That could be especially daunting for Tanden, the former adviser to Hillary Clinton and the president of the center-left Center for American Progress, given her history of political combat. </p>\n<p>Biden\u2019s transition team released a litany of praise for Tanden from figures including Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams.</p>\n<p>Other Democrats also rushed to defend Tanden\u2019s nomination. Former Obama aide Valerie Jarrett said Tanden \u201cgrew up on welfare and lived in public housing. She experienced first hand the importance of our social programs. Her extraordinary career has been devoted to improving opportunities for working families. She is an excellent choice to lead OMB.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNeera Tanden is smart, experienced, and qualified for the position of OMB Director,\u201d added Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, a member of the party\u2019s progressive wing. \u201cThe American people decisively voted for change - Mitch McConnell shouldn\u2019t block us from having a functioning government that gets to work for the people we serve.\u201d</p>\n<p>On the Senate floor, Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said it\u2019s impossible to take Republicans\u2019 criticism of Tanden seriously.</p>\n<p>\u201cHonestly, the hypocrisy is astounding. If Republicans are concerned about criticism on Twitter, their complaints are better directed at President Trump,\u201d Schumer said.</p>\n<p>At OMB, Tanden would be responsible for preparing Biden\u2019s budget submission and would command several hundred budget analysts, economists and policy advisers with deep knowledge of the inner workings of the government.</p>\n<p>If Democrats should win runoff elections for Georgia\u2019s two GOP-held Senate seats, Tanden\u2019s job would become hugely important because the party would gain a slim majority in the chamber. That would allow them to pass special budget legislation that could roll back Trump\u2019s tax cuts, boost the Affordable Care Act and pursue other spending goals. OMB would have a central role in such legislation.</p>\n<p>Top Democrats, Biden included, supported anti-deficit packages earlier in their careers, but the party has since changed. Biden was a force behind the establishment of the Obama deficit commission, which was created to win votes of Democratic moderates to pass an increase in the government\u2019s borrowing cap and was chaired by former Clinton White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles.</p>\n<p>Tanden shares a commonly held view among Democratic lawmakers that Republicans usually profess concerns about deficits only when Democrats are in power, pointing to tax cut packages passed in the opening year of Trump\u2019s administration and former President George W. Bush\u2019s 2001 tax cut.</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>Taylor reported from Washington.</p>"

                "body": "<p>ROME (AP) \u2014 The pope\u2019s former treasurer, Cardinal George Pell, said Monday he feels a dismayed sense of vindication as the financial mismanagement he tried to uncover in the Holy See is now being exposed in a spiraling Vatican corruption investigation.</p>\n<p>Pell made the comments to The Associated Press in his first interview since returning to Rome after his conviction-turned-acquittal on sexual abuse charges in his native Australia. Pell told the AP that he knew in 2014 when he took the treasury job that the Holy See\u2019s finances were \u201ca bit of a mess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI never, never thought it would be as Technicolor as it proved,\u201d Pell said from his living room armchair in his apartment just outside St. Peter\u2019s Square. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that there was so much criminality involved.\u201d </p>\n<p>Pell spoke to the AP before the Dec. 15 release of the first volume of his jailhouse memoir, \u201cPrison Journal,\u201d chronicling the first five months of the 404 days he spent in solitary confinement in a Melbourne lockup.</p>\n<p>Pell left his job as prefect of the Vatican\u2019s economy ministry in 2017 to face charges that he sexually molested two 13-year-old choir boys in the sacristy of the Melbourne cathedral in 1996. After a first jury deadlocked, a second unanimously convicted him and he was sentenced to six years in prison. The conviction was upheld on appeal only to be thrown out by Australia\u2019s High Court, which in April found there was reasonable doubt in the testimony of his lone accuser.</p>\n<p>In the prison diary, Pell reflects on the nature of suffering, Pope Francis\u2019 papacy and the humiliations of solitary confinement as he battled to clear his name for a crime he insists he never committed. </p>\n<p>Pell and his supporters believe he was scapegoated for all the crimes of the Australian Catholic Church\u2019s botched response to clergy sexual abuse. Victims and critics say he epitomizes everything wrong with how the church has dealt with the problem. </p>\n<p>In the book, Pell makes repeated reference his three years at the Vatican trying to impose international accounting, budgeting and transparency standards on the Holy See\u2019s notoriously siloed bureaucracy, where prefects guard their money, turf and power as fiefdoms.</p>\n<p>That secretive culture has come under a microscope as Vatican prosecutors investigate the Vatican secretariat of state\u2019s 350 million-euro investment in a London real estate venture and the tens of millions of euros in donations from the faithful that it paid to Italian middlemen to manage the deal.</p>\n<p>After more than a year of investigation, no one has been indicted, though a handful of Vatican officials and Italian businessmen are under investigation. Pell said he is watching the developments as they unfold. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt just might be staggering incompetence,\u201d he said of the scandal, adding that he hoped eventual trials would ascertain the truth.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt would be better for the church if these things hadn\u2019t happened, if I wasn\u2019t vindicated in this way,\u201d he said. \u201cBut given that they have happened, it\u2019s quite clear,\u201d that the reforms he sought to impose were necessary.</p>\n<p>Pell, with his rather brusque, no-nonsense Australian sensibilities, clashed frequently with the Vatican\u2019s Italian old guard as he sought to get a handle on the Vatican\u2019s assets and spending. His most well-known nemesis was the then-No. 3 in the Vatican\u2019s secretariat of state, Cardinal Angelo Becciu. </p>\n<p>Pell famously boasted in 2014 that he had \u201cdiscovered\u201d hundreds of millions of dollars that were \u201ctucked away in particular sectional accounts and did not appear on the balance sheet\u201d -- a reference to the secretary of state\u2019s in-house asset portfolio that Becciu controlled that never appeared on the Vatican\u2019s consolidated financial statements.</p>\n<p>Becciu hasn\u2019t been charged in the corruption investigation, but it came as little surprise that Pell issued a blistering statement after Francis on Sept. 24 fired Becciu, over apparently unrelated allegations of embezzlement, which Becciu denies. </p>\n<p>Pell congratulated Francis then and said: \u201cI hope the cleaning of the stables continues in both the Vatican and Victoria,\u201d a reference to his home state of Victoria, where he was initially convicted.</p>\n<p>After Pell returned to Rome last month, he had a well-publicized private audience with Francis. </p>\n<p>\u201cHe acknowledged what I was trying to do,\u201d Pell said of the pope. \u201cAnd, you know, I think it\u2019s been sadly vindicated by revelations and developments.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pell and his lawyers have suggested a possible link between the resistance he faced in his reform efforts at the Vatican and his forced departure from Rome to face prosecution in Australia.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope for the sake of the church, there\u2019s nothing in it,\u201d Pell said. \u201cIn fact \u2014 I say that quite sincerely \u2014 because some Australian people, my own family, said to me: \u2019Well, if the Mafia is going after you or somebody else is going after you, that\u2019s one thing. It\u2019s a little bit worse if it comes from within the church.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pell said he\u2019s not sure if there is a connection or not. </p>\n<p>\u201cBut I think we will find out, whether there is or there isn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly the party\u2019s not over.\u201d</p>"

(AP) \u2014 Joe Biden on Monday got his first look as president-elect at the President\u2019s Daily Brief, a top secret summary of U.S. intelligence and world events \u2014 a document former first lady Michelle Obama has called \u201cThe Death, Destruction, and Horrible Things Book.\u201d</p>\n<p>Biden has already had eyes on at least three different iterations of the so-called PDB, which is tailored to the way each president likes to absorb information. </p>\n<p>More than a decade ago, Biden read former President George W. Bush\u2019s PDB during his transition into the vice presidency. After that, he read Obama\u2019s PDB for eight years. Now, after a four-year break, he\u2019s reading President Donald Trump\u2019s PDB.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe briefers almost certainly will be asking Biden what he prefers in terms of format and style,\u201d said David Priess, author of \u201cThe President\u2019s Book of Secrets,\u201d a history of the PDB. \u201cAt a minimum, they\u2019re seeing what seems to resonate most with him so that when they make the book his book, they can tailor it to him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Obama\u2019s PDB was a 10- to 15-page document tucked in a leather binder, which he found waiting for him on the breakfast table. Later in his presidency, he liked reading the ultra-secret intelligence brief on a secured iPad. </p>\n<p>\u201cMichelle called it \u201cThe Death, Destruction, and Horrible Things Book,\u201d Obama wrote in his recently released book, \u201dA Promised Land.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOn a given day, I might read about terrorist cells in Somalia or unrest in Iraq or the fact that the Chinese or Russians were developing new weapons systems,\u201d Obama wrote. \u201cNearly always, there was mention of potential terrorist plots, no matter how vague, thinly sourced, or unactionable \u2014 a form of due diligence on the part of the intelligence community, meant to avoid the kind of second-guessing that had transpired after 9/11.\u201d </p>\n<p>From now until Inauguration Day, Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will be reading the PDB crafted for Trump, who had delayed giving Biden and Harris access to it as he contests the outcome of the election. </p>\n<p>Trump, who prefers absorbing information in visual ways, likes short texts and graphics. </p>\n<p>\u201cTrump himself said during his campaign and during the transition in 2016 that he did not like reading long documents \u2014 that he preferred bullet points,\u201d said Priess, who has not seen any of Trump\u2019s PDBs. \u201cIt probably has charts, tables, graphs \u2014 things like that. Not the parody that people make that it\u2019s like a cartoon book ... but something that is more visual. But we don\u2019t know for sure.\u201d </p>\n<p>The written brief, which Trump doesn\u2019t always read, often is followed by a verbal briefing with an intelligence official, although those oral briefings stopped at least for a time in October. Priess said he didn\u2019t know why they stopped or if they had resumed, but that they stopped at a time when Trump was spending much of his time on the campaign trail. </p>\n<p>Before Trump authorized Biden to get the PDB as president-elect, Biden was given some intelligence background briefings as a candidate. But they were more general and did not include the nation\u2019s top secrets.</p>\n<p>The other thing that a president-elect gets is a briefing \u201con CIA\u2019s covert actions,\u201d former acting CIA director Mike Morell said at an event hosted by the Center for Presidential Transition based in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s important for the president-elect to get this briefing ... because on Inauguration Day, these covert actions will become the new president\u2019s.\u201d </p>\n<p>In 1961, President John F. Kennedy read his first brief while sitting on the diving board of a swimming pool at his retreat in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. President Lyndon Johnson liked to read his brief in the afternoon. President Richard Nixon relied on his national security adviser Henry Kissinger to peruse the briefs and tell him what he thought the president should know. </p>\n<p>As the laborious recount of ballots dragged on in 2000, former President Bill Clinton decided that then-Gov. George W. Bush should get access to his PDB just in case he was the winner. Bush became was the first president to read it before he was president-elect. </p>\n<p>Biden is getting the PDB later than usual because of Trump\u2019s ongoing protest of the election results. Trump approved the briefings for Biden last Tuesday, a day after his administration approved the formal transition process to his successor. </p>\n<p>When Biden walks into the Oval Office, he\u2019ll be inheriting nuclear threats from North Korea and Iran, changing political dynamics in the Middle East, the winding down of America\u2019s presence in Afghanistan and rising competition from China.</p>\n<p>Biden had access to the PDB in Wilmington, Delaware. Harris received it in a secure room at the Commerce Department, where the presidential transition offices are located. </p>\n<p>Even Biden, who has decades of experience in foreign policy, could be the victim of an old political adage that no matter how informed he thinks he is, he could learn otherwise from the PDB. </p>\n<p>Former CIA Director Michael Hayden wrote in his book that revelations and new insight found in the PDB are known as \u201caw s---\u201d moments. As in: \u201cAw s---,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwish we hadn\u2019t said that during that campaign stop in Buffalo.\u201d</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>Riechmann reported from Washington. </p>"

                "body": "<p>SAN RAMON, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Zoom\u2019s videoconferencing service remains a fixture in pandemic life, but its breakneck growth is showing signs of tapering off as investors debate whether the company will be able to build upon its recent success after a vaccine enables people to intermingle again.</p>\n<p>For now, Zoom is thriving as tens of millions of people who never heard of the service at the beginning of the year rely on its video meeting tools to connect with their co-workers, teachers, friends and family while efforts to fight contain the pandemic prevent them from going into offices, schools and most many other places. That dependence boosted Zoom\u2019s fortunes, producing a pandemic-driven success story that was highlighted again Monday with the release of the company\u2019s quarterly results for the August-October period.</p>\n<p>Zoom\u2019s revenue more than quadrupled from the same time last year to $777 million, yielding a profit of $198 million, up from just $2.2 million a year ago. Both those figures easily topped the estimates among analyst surveyed by FactSet Research, but Zoom\u2019s stock still shed 5% in Monday \u2019s extended trading after the numbers came out.</p>\n<p>One possible reason for the reaction is that number of companies anteing up for Zoom\u2019s subscription version of its service isn\u2019t rising as rapidly as during the pandemic\u2019s early stages. Zoom ended its latest quarter with 433,700 customers with at least 10 employees, an increase of 63,500 customers from July. In each of the previous two quarters, Zoom had added more than 100,000 customers with at least 10 employees.</p>\n<p>While that slowdown was considered an inevitable, the drop-off is nevertheless causing many investors to start considering the possibility that Zoom won\u2019t be able to maintain the momentum it gained from this year\u2019s stay-at-home orders after a substantial portion of the population is vaccinated against the novel coronavirus that has killed more than 1.4 million people worldwide.</p>\n<p>As more investors have conclude Zoom has already reached its zenith, the company\u2019s stock price has fallen more than 20% from its all-time high of $588.84 reached last month. Despite the decline, the shares are still more than six times higher than where they ended last year. </p>\n<p>Those still betting on Zoom believe many subscribers who signed up for subscriptions to the videoconferencing service during the pandemic will continue to pay for it after the crisis is over as companies continue to limit the number of employees into their offices and cut back on business travel after learning how much can be accomplished in virtual meetings. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe trends of remote work had started long before the pandemic and they have just been accelerated by this,\u201d Kelly Steckelberg, Zoom\u2019s chief financial officer, said Monday in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cGiven the adoption and the way we have seen all segments, from small business owners to individuals all the way up to large organizations, embrace Zoom, we really expect that those remote working trends will continue even after there is a vaccine.\u201d</p>\n<p>In a reflection of the high hopes for Zoom, analysts polled by FactSet predict the company\u2019s revenue next year will reach $3.1 billion. That would be a roughly 20% increase from revenue of nearly $2.6 billion that Zoom is projecting for this year. An effective vaccine also would probably widen Zoom\u2019s profit margins because it is spending more money this year offering a free service to about 125,000 schools that are instructing students online instead of in classrooms.</p>\n<p>But Nucleus Research analyst Trevor White thinks Zoom is more likely to become known as a \u201cone-hit wonder\u201d after the pandemic, partly because of competition from bigger companies such as Microsoft and Google that can also bundle together other business products with their videoconferencing services. </p>\n<p>\u201cZoom\u2019s spike in consumer demand has given it a competitive edge that cannot transition well into the reopened economy,\u201d White predicted. </p>"

As if that weren\u2019t enough for one weekend, it was also confirmed that Major will have to share the White House with, of all things, a cat.</p>\n<p>It\u2019ll get better, Major.</p>\n<p>In a few weeks, Major, fellow German shepherd Champ and the TBD feline are expected to make the move to the White House. Presidential pets provide their owners with a source of comfort, entertainment, occasional drama and generally good PR.</p>\n<p>The arrival of the Biden pets will also mark the next chapter in a long history of pets residing at the White House after a four-year hiatus during the Trump administration.</p>\n<p>\u201cPets have always played an important role in the White House throughout the decades,\u201d said Jennifer Pickens, an author who studies White House traditions. \u201cIt not only provides companionship to the president and their family, but I believe it also humanizes and softens their political image.\u201d</p>\n<p>Having a dog or cat will give some pet-loving constituents a connection with the president, added Tom Whalen, a presidential historian at Boston University.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen a president, the leader of the country, the leader of the free world really, is seen with a dog or a cat, you know, basically there is a bond that they have with their public, whether they\u2019re Republican or Democrat,\u201d Whalen said.</p>\n<p>President Theodore Roosevelt had Skip, who is described by the White House Historical Association as a \u201cshort-legged Black and Tan mongrel terrier brought home from a Colorado bear hunt.\u201d Warren G. Harding had Laddie Boy, who sat in on meetings and had his own Cabinet chair. And President Franklin Delano Roosevelt had his beloved terrier Fala. At night, Fala slept in a special chair at the foot of the president\u2019s bed.</p>\n<p>More recently, President George H.W. Bush\u2019s English springer spaniel Millie was featured on \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d and starred in a bestseller, \u201cMillie\u2019s Book: As dictated to Barbara Bush.\u201d Hillary Clinton followed Bush\u2019s lead with a children\u2019s book about family dog Buddy and cat Socks: \u201cDear Socks, Dear Buddy: Kids\u2019 Letters to the First Pets.\u201d</p>\n<p>When he declared victory in the 2008 presidential race, Barack Obama told his daughters: \u201cYou have earned the new puppy that\u2019s coming with us to the White House.\u201d Several months later, Bo joined the family, a gift from Sen. Ted Kennedy. A few years later, fellow Portuguese water dog Sunny would arrive to provide companionship. </p>\n<p>Among the stranger White House pets was Calvin Coolidge and first lady Grace Coolidge\u2019s raccoon named Rebecca. She was given to the Coolidge family by a supporter who suggested the raccoon be served for Thanksgiving dinner, according to the White House Historical Association. But instead she got an embroidered collar with the title \u201cWhite House Raccoon\u201d and entertained children at the White House Easter Egg Roll.</p>\n<p>Some notable pets belonged to first kids, including Amy Carter\u2019s Siamese cat, Misty Malarky Ying Yang, and Caroline Kennedy\u2019s pony, Macaroni. The Kennedy family had a veritable menagerie, complete with dogs, cats, birds, hamsters and a rabbit named Zsa Zsa.</p>\n<p>President Harry Truman famously said that \u201cIf you want a friend in Washington, get a dog.\u201d It should not be a surprise that many presidents have taken him up on that advice. The first President Bush once said, \u201cThere is nothing like the unconditional love of a dog to help you get through the rough spots.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFrom a presidential perspective, you know, a dog or cat or horse, they\u2019re great because they\u2019re nonjudgmental. They\u2019re going to give you their unqualified love. And they\u2019re not going to criticize what you did in Somalia or how the economy is doing,\u201d Whalen said. \u201cThe pets are always there for you. And I think presidents, whether you\u2019re a Democrat or Republican, need that kind of reassurance from time to time, given how things are.\u201d</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>Associated Press video journalist Mike Householder contributed to this report from Detroit.</p>"

                "body": "<p>NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Newly detained immigrants must appear before a judge within 10 days, rather than the weeks or months they\u2019ve sometimes had to endure in recent years, a judge said Monday.</p>\n<p>Civil rights groups praised the ruling by U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan as the first of its kind in the nation to set such a rule for the U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agency.</p>\n<p>They said in a release that the ruling would strike a blow to federal immigration authorities who hold detained immigrants indefinitely before they appear before a judge.</p>\n<p>The judge said a law authorizing the detention of immigrants while removal proceedings are pending \u201cdoes not negate class members\u2019 interests \u2014 of the utmost importance \u2014 in freedom from imprisonment.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cClass members may not have a \u2018fundamental right to be released during removal proceedings,\u2019 but nor does the Government have an unfettered right to detain them,\u201d she added.</p>\n<p>In 2014, the average wait to see a judge was 11 days, but it had stretched to over a month in 2017 and nearly three months in 2018, according to the judge\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p>Messages for comment was sent to the Justice Department, which represented the agency in court, and ICE, which falls under the Department of Homeland Security.</p>\n<p>\u201cA few weeks or months of sitting in inhumane ICE detention facilities can be dangerous and devastating for individuals and their families,\u201d said Niji Jain, an attorney at The Bronx Defenders. \u201cThe Court\u2019s ruling recognizes that prompt access to an immigration judge is a fundamental right \u2014 one that is all the more important when detention facilities are hotbeds for the spread of COVID-19.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLocking people up for months before they first see a judge during immigration proceedings is unjust and unlawful, and it does immense harm to immigrant families,\u201d said Bobby Hodgson, staff attorney at the New York Civil Liberties Union.</p>\n<p>Class member Shemar Michel said ICE officers told him he\u2019d be home by dinner time when they picked him up as he prepared his children for school. He said he didn\u2019t see a judge for six weeks.</p>\n<p>\u201cDuring that time, I was mentally shattered, I missed my son\u2019s second birthday, and I felt like I had no chance to fight my case. I told the ICE officers I would rather buy my own plane ticket home than stay in ICE detention any longer,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope the judge\u2019s ruling ensures nobody will have to go through what I went through.\u201d</p>\n<p>The civil rights groups said in their release that many individuals held for months were entitled to release. They said about 40% of them were eventually released on bond. Others, they added, were U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents.</p>\n<p>The groups said the average petitioners have lived in the United States for 16 years and nearly a third are lawful permanent residents.</p>\n<p>The judge granted class action status to a lawsuit by civil rights groups filed two years ago in Manhattan federal court. She noted that the federal government had never filed arguments opposing the designation.</p>"

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the independent Minnesota Public Utilities Commission gave their final approvals last week. </p>\n<p>\u201cThis project has had the most extensive review in Minnesota history,\u201d Gov. Tim Walz told reporters. He said his position all along has been that the state needed to follow the regulatory process, the law and the science. </p>\n<p>The company and its supporters welcomed the decision, but opponents have vowed to keep up their fight.</p>\n<p>\u201cConstruction can now begin,\u201d Enbridge spokeswoman Juli Kellner said in a statement that didn\u2019t specify when that would happen.</p>\n<p>But Enbridge has signaled that the start could be imminent. The company notified landowners along the route via letters earlier in the month that it expected construction to \u201cstart on approximately November 30.\u201d The company has previously said it expected the work to take about nine months. </p>\n<p>\u201cThis is the culmination of six years of evidence and science-based review of the project,\u201d Kellner said. \u201cLine 3 is poised to provide significant economic benefits for counties, small businesses, Native American communities, and union members \u2013 bringing 4,200 family-sustaining, mostly local construction jobs, millions of dollars in local spending and additional tax revenues at a time when Northern Minnesota needs it most.\u201d</p>\n<p>But two tribes \u2014 the Red Lake and White Earth Bands of Chippewa \u2014 asked the PUC last week to stay its approval of the project, saying the influx of construction workers would put residents along the route at higher risk of COVID-19. A consolidated appeal by environmental and tribal groups is also pending before the Minnesota Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>Opponents say the project threatens spills in pristine waters where Native Americans harvest wild rice and that the Canadian tar sands oil it plans to carry would aggravate climate change.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that Minnesota is issuing permits for an unnecessary tar sands pipeline during a global pandemic that is particularly hitting hard Native and non-native communities and fragile healthcare systems along the route even though the appeals process is still underway,\u201d Winona LaDuke, executive director of Honor the Earth, said in a statement. \u201cThis is just reckless and irresponsible government that will have consequences for all sides.\u201d</p>\n<p>Margaret Levin, director of the Minnesota chapter of the Sierra Club, said the approval is \u201ccompletely out of step\u201d with the Walz administration\u2019s stated goals of protecting communities and the environment.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe will not allow the state\u2019s reckless approval of this tar sands pipeline to go unchallenged and urge that any construction be stayed to allow the legal issues ... to be fully considered by the courts,\u201d Levin said in a statement.</p>\n<p>Enbridge said replacing the deteriorating pipeline, which was built in the 1960s and runs at only half its original capacity, is the best option for protecting the environment while meeting the region\u2019s energy needs. The company said it has instituted strict coronavirus testing and screening protocols for workers to protect them and surrounding communities.</p>\n<p>\u201cThousands of our friends and neighbors across Minnesota look forward to using their construction skills to protect our environment and communities by replacing an existing deteriorating pipeline,\u201d Joel Smith, president of the Minnesota and North Dakota council of the Laborers\u2019 International Union of North America.</p>\n<p>Line 3 begins in Alberta, Canada, and clips a corner of North Dakota before crossing Minnesota on its way to Enbridge\u2019s terminal in Superior, Wisconsin. The replacement segments in Canada, North Dakota and Wisconsin are already complete, leaving only the 337-mile (542-kilometer) stretch in Minnesota. Altogether Enbridge expects to spend $2.9 billion on the U.S. portion. </p>\n<p>\u201cThis project has faced years of scrutiny and unprecedented obstruction from Democrats and their allies,\u201d Republican Minnesota House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt, of Crown, said in a statement. But he added that the process \u201cultimately\u201d process worked. </p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s get to work on the Line 3 pipeline,\u201d he said.</p>"

                "byline": "By ANDREW TAYLOR",
                "body": "<p>WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 After months of shadowboxing amid a tense and toxic campaign, Capitol Hill\u2019s main players are returning for one final, perhaps futile, attempt at deal-making on a challenging menu of year-end business. </p>\n<p>COVID-19 relief, a $1.4 trillion catchall spending package, and defense policy \u2014 and a final burst of judicial nominees \u2014 dominate a truncated two- or three-week session occurring as the coronavirus pandemic rockets out of control in President Donald Trump\u2019s final weeks in office.</p>\n<p>The only absolute must-do business is preventing a government shutdown when a temporary spending bill expires on Dec. 11. The route preferred by top lawmakers like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is to agree upon and pass an omnibus spending bill for the government. But it may be difficult to overcome bitter divisions regarding a long-delayed COVID-19 relief package that\u2019s a top priority of business, state and local governments, educators and others. </p>\n<p>McConnell is focusing on confirming Trump\u2019s remaining judicial nominations, including a vote Monday on a district judge in Mississippi and at least one additional appeals court vacancy.</p>\n<p>Time is working against lawmakers as well, as is the Capitol\u2019s emerging status as a COVID-19 hotspot. The House has truncated its schedule, and Senate Republicans are joining Democrats in forgoing the in-person lunch meetings that usually anchor their workweeks. It\u2019ll take serious, good-faith conversations among top players to determine what\u2019s possible, but those haven\u2019t transpired yet. </p>\n<p>Top items for December\u2019s lame-duck session:</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>KEEPING THE GOVERNMENT OPEN</p>\n<p>At a bare minimum, lawmakers need to keep the government running by passing a stopgap spending bill known as a continuing resolution, which would punt $1.4 trillion worth of unfinished agency spending into next year. </p>\n<p>That\u2019s a typical way to deal with a handoff to a new administration, but McConnell and Pelosi are two veterans of the Capitol\u2019s appropriations culture and are pressing hard for a catchall spending package. A battle over using budget sleight of hand to add a 2 percentage point, $12 billion increase to domestic programs to accommodate rapidly growing veterans health care spending is an issue, as are Trump\u2019s demands for U.S-Mexico border wall funding.</p>\n<p>Getting Trump to sign the measure is another challenge. Two years ago he sparked a lengthy partial government shutdown over the border wall, but both sides would like to clear away the pile of unfinished legislation to give the Biden administration a fresh start. The changeover in administrations probably wouldn\u2019t affect an omnibus deal very much.</p>\n<p>At issue are the 12 annual spending bills comprising the portion of the government\u2019s budget that passes through Congress each year on a bipartisan basis. Whatever approach passes, it\u2019s likely to contain a batch of unfinished leftovers such as extending expiring health care policies and continuing the authorization for the government\u2019s flood insurance program.</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>COVID-19 RELIEF</p>\n<p>Democrats have battled with Republicans and the White House for months over a fresh installment of COVID-19 relief that all sides say they want. But a lack of good faith and an unwillingness to embark on compromises that might lead either side out of their political comfort zones have helped keep another rescue package on ice. </p>\n<p>The aid remains out of reach despite a fragile economy and out-of-control increases in coronavirus cases, especially in Midwest GOP strongholds. McConnell has supplanted Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin as the most important Republican force in the negotiations, but he hasn\u2019t shown much openness for politically difficult compromises required for a COVID-19 deal that might anger conservatives. Neither have McConnell\u2019s warnings of a wave of COVID-related lawsuits against businesses, schools and nonprofits open during the pandemic come to pass, undercutting his demand for blanket protections against such suits.</p>\n<p>Pelosi seems to have overplayed her hand as she held out for $2 trillion-plus right up until the election. The results of the election, which saw Democrats lose seats in the House, appear to have significantly undercut her position, but she is holding firm on another round of aid to state and local governments.</p>\n<p>Before the election, Trump seemed to be focused on a provision that would send another round of $1,200 payments to most Americans. He hasn\u2019t shown a lot of interest in the topic since, apart from stray tweets.

Louis Kealoha, who agreed to retire amid the wide-ranging federal investigation, is scheduled to be sentenced later Monday in a separate hearing. </p>\n<p>\u201cThis case has staggered the community in many ways,\u201d U.S. District Judge J. Michael Seabright said, describing how Katherine Kealoha orchestrated a reverse mortgage scheme that forced her grandmother to sell her home, framed her uncle for stealing the Kealohas\u2019 home mailbox, stole money from children whose trusts she controlled as a lawyer, cheated her uncle out of his life savings, convinced her firefighter lover to lie about their affair and used her position as a prosecutor to turn a drug investigation away from her physician brother. </p>\n<p>\u201cTruth can be stranger than fiction,\u201d the judge said.</p>\n<p>Her lawyer asked for a sentence of eight years, while prosecutors sought 14 years. </p>\n<p>A jury convicted the Kealohas last year of conspiracy, along with two former officers who are scheduled to be sentenced Tuesday. </p>\n<p>To avoid a second trial, the Kealohas later pleaded guilty to bank fraud, saying they provided false information to obtain loans. </p>\n<p>Katherine Kealoha, 51, also pleaded guilty to an identity theft charge, saying she got a police officer to forge a police report she used to explain negative information on a credit report. She also pleaded guilty to a charge that involved protecting her brother from the drug investigation.</p>\n<p>In a letter to the judge, she blamed a prescription drug addiction for clouding her judgement. </p>\n<p>\u201cMy client was on drugs, her mind was not clear and she did a lot of bad things,\u201d her lawyer, Gary Singh, said in court. </p>\n<p>Kealoha apologized to her family in court and asked for forgiveness. \u201cTo my uncle, especially,\u201d she said. \u201cI know that he has been through so much pain and so much hurt.\u201d </p>\n<p>Kealoha\u2019s aunt, Charlotte Puana Malott, read a letter she said her mother, Florence Puana, wrote before she died at 100 in February about her granddaughter\u2019s \u201cruthless scheme.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was 90 years old in 2009 when I agreed to a reverse mortgage on my home, not really understanding what it meant. It seemed complicated, yet I trusted you Katherine,\u201d the letter said. </p>\n<p>Kealoha came to Puana and her son Gerard Puana with an idea about taking out a reverse mortgage on her grandmother\u2019s home to help buy a condo her uncle wanted. Kealoha said she would consolidate her debts and promised her uncle and grandmother that she would pay off the loan.</p>\n<p>She used the money to buy her uncle\u2019s condo, but instead of paying off the loan, she spent the leftover money on luxuries, including $26,000 for an induction banquet when her husband became police chief and $10,000 on Mercedes-Benz and Maserati car payments, the judge said. </p>\n<p>\u201cShe perverted justice. And she did so for her own personal reasons,\u201d said Michael Wheat, a special federal prosecutor. \u201cTo facilitate a lifestyle and a facade and an image in this community.\u201d </p>\n<p>Framing her uncle was to make him less credible in the family financial dispute, Judge Seabright said. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know sitting here today, who stole the mailbox,\u201d he said, adding that it clearly wasn\u2019t Gerard Puana. </p>\n<p>She used the police \u201cto do your dirty work,\u201d Seabright told Kealoha. </p>\n<p>Louis Kealoha filed for divorce after they were convicted. </p>\n<p>Monday\u2019s sentencing hearings come after several postponements. Concern about the spread of the coronavirus delayed the proceedings in March. A Nov. 3 date was changed after officials realized that was Election Day. </p>\n<p>\u201cCOVID has kept us from this date for quite a while,\u201d the judge said. </p>"

A few minutes later, Mangakahia got a steal and scored her first points in almost two years on a fast-break layup.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere was a lot going through my mind,\u201d Mangakahia said after the 50-39 victory over Stony Brook. \u201cEspecially on the bus. In the warmups, there was less emotions because I was just focused. But on the bus, I was very emotional and I just couldn\u2019t believe that this day was here and I was going to be able to play.\u201d</p>\n<p>CORONAVIRUS COUNT: Over the first five days of the season, 69 games were either canceled or postponed because of COVID-19.

                "body": "<p>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) \u2014 With unemployment still high and the pandemic threatening yet another economic slump, President-elect Joe Biden is assembling a team of liberal advisers who have long focused on the nation\u2019s workers and government efforts to address economic inequality.</p>\n<p>Janet Yellen, announced Monday as Biden\u2019s nominee for treasury secretary, served as chair of the Federal Reserve from 2014 to 2018, when she placed a  greater emphasis than previous Fed chairs on maximizing employment and less focus on price inflation. Biden also named Cecilia Rouse as chair of his Council of Economic Advisers, and Heather Boushey and Jared Bernstein as members of the council.</p>\n<p>All are outspoken supporters of more government stimulus spending to boost growth, a major issue with the coronavirus pandemic cramping the U.S. economy.</p>\n<p>Those choices \u201csignal the desire of the Biden administration to take the CEA in a direction that really centers on working people and raising wages,\u201d said Heidi Shierholz, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute and former Labor Department chief economist during the Obama administration.</p>\n<p>Biden\u2019s nominees are also a more personally diverse group than those of previous presidents.</p>\n<p>Yellen, if confirmed by the Senate, would be the first woman to serve as treasury secretary, after breaking ground as the first woman to chair the Fed. Rouse would be the first Black woman to lead the CEA in its 74 years of existence. And Neera Tanden, Biden\u2019s pick for director of the Office of Management and Budget, would be the first South Asian American in that job.</p>\n<p>Biden also selected Wally Adeyemo to be Yellen\u2019s deputy, which would make him the first Black deputy treasury secretary. Rouse, Tanden and Adeyemo will all require Senate confirmation, and Tanden in particular is already drawing heavy Republican criticism.</p>\n<p>Along with its progressive cast, Biden\u2019s team also has years of experience in government and policymaking. And that\u2019s earning plaudits from some conservatives, who note that the nominees are not a far-left group bent on strangling the economy, as President Donald Trump repeatedly warned during the 2020 campaign.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey are intellectual liberals, but not burn-it-all-down socialists,\u201d said Brian Riedl, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and an adviser to Sen. Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign. \u201cThey\u2019re fairly conventional liberal economists and experts.\u201d</p>\n<p>Still, the Biden administration\u2019s ambitious goals will face solid opposition from Republicans in Congress. The GOP needs to win one of two Georgia Senate seats in a Jan. 5 special election to retain control of the Senate, and the Republicans made major inroads on Nov. 3 in the Democrats\u2019 House majority.</p>\n<p>\u201cMost of the policies that Biden ran on will not survive a Republican Senate,\u201d Riedl said. Those include proposals to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and significantly increase taxes on wealthy Americans. </p>\n<p>Biden could secure another round of stimulus spending early next year, particularly if the recent spikes in confirmed virus cases push the economy into recession again. But such a package will likely have to come in under $1 trillion to get Senate Republican support, Riedl said, rather than the higher figure House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is seeking.</p>\n<p>Tanden is the president and CEO of the liberal think tank Center for American Progress and was the director of domestic policy for the Obama-Biden presidential campaign. She first made her mark in the Clinton orbit, and served as policy director for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential race. </p>\n<p>A spokesman for GOP Sen. John Cornyn of Texas tweeted that Tanden \u201cstands zero chance of being confirmed\u201d as budget director, citing \u201can an endless stream of disparaging comments about\u201d Republican senators. And Josh Holmes, a political adviser to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, tweeted that her confirmation was likely doomed. </p>\n<p>Brian Deese, a former senior economic adviser in the Obama administration and now the managing director and global head of sustainable investing at BlackRock, is expected to be named director of the White House National Economic Council, according to a person familiar with transition plans who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.</p>\n<p>Deese worked on the auto bailout and environmental issues in the Obama White House, where he held the title of deputy director of both the NEC and the OMB. </p>\n<p>Deese and Adeyemo are both under fire from progressives for their connections to BlackRock, a giant Wall Street asset management firm. BlackRock has sought to avoid greater regulatory scrutiny by Treasury. And many activists assail the firm for owning huge stakes in oil and gas companies. </p>\n<p>Rouse, a labor economist and head of Princeton University\u2019s School of Public and International Affairs, served on the CEA from 2009 to 2011, and served on the NEC from 1998 to 1999 in the Clinton administration.</p>\n<p>Notably, she organized a letter earlier this year signed by more than 100 economists calling for more government action to help Americans caused by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe planning for a fairer economy, grounded in facts and evidence, begins now,\u201d Rouse tweeted Monday.</p>\n<p>Alan Blinder, former vice chair of the Fed and a currently an economics professor at Princeton, praised Rouse\u2019s management style and her expertise in the economics of education and workforce training. Biden has proposed making two years of community college tuition-free. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat kind of stuff is right in her wheelhouse,\u201d Blinder said. </p>\n<p>Boushey, picked to be one of the three members of the CEA, is president and co-founder of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a think tank focused on inequality. The center conducts its own research and also provides grants to mostly left-leaning academics to study aspects of inequality.</p>\n<p>Bernstein, also nominated for the CEA, was an adviser to then-Vice President Biden during the Obama administration before becoming a fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank. Bernstein has also worked as a social worker and was an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a labor-supported think tank.</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>Associated Press writers Alexandra Jaffe, Paul Wiseman and Michael Balsamo contributed to this report.</p>"

                "body": "<p>NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 General Motors will not be taking a stake in the electric vehicle company Nikola, and the company said Monday that it was scuttling one of its marquee vehicles, an electric and hydrogen-powered pickup, after GM pulled technological support from the project. </p>\n<p>Shares of Nikola plunged 24%. </p>\n<p>Nikola on Monday released updated terms between the companies for a supply agreement related to GM\u2019s fuel-cell system, replacing an agreement signed in September. That deal would have given GM an 11% stake in Nikola. </p>\n<p>The early agreement would also have allowed Nikola to use GM\u2019s new battery electric truck underpinnings for its electric and hydrogen-powered pickup called the Badger, and its fuel cell and battery technology as well. That is no longer part of the agreement, essentially gutting Nikola\u2019s plans for the Badger. </p>\n<p>Nikola said Monday that it will begin refunding deposits made by customers who wanted first dibs on that pickup. </p>\n<p>\u201cIn a nutshell, the signing of GM as a partner is a positive but ultimately no ownership/equity stake in Nikola and the billions of R&D potentially now off the table is a major negative blow to the Nikola story,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. \u201cThis went from a game changer deal for Nikola to a good supply partnership but nothing to write home about.\u201d</p>\n<p>There were hints that the partnership was going sideways in late September as a deadline for an binding agreement approached. GM said then that negotiations about its $2 billion role were ongoing, sending shares of Nikola sliding. </p>\n<p>That announcement came just days after Nikola founder and Chairman Trevor Milton resigned after Hindenburg Research, a company that\u2019s betting Nikola stock will drop, accused Nikola of Fraud. </p>\n<p>Hindenburg said Nikola\u2019s success was an \u201cintricate fraud,\u201d including a video showing a truck rolling downhill to give the impression it was cruising on a highway, and stenciling the words \u201chydrogen electric\u201d on the side of a vehicle that was actually powered by natural gas. </p>\n<p>Nikola denies the allegations and called them misleading. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department are reportedly investigating. </p>\n<p>On Monday, GM spokesman Jim Cain said the revised agreement is more focused. He said the new memorandum of understanding will help Nikola produce its commercial trucks, and help GM commercialize its fuel cell technology. </p>\n<p>Nikola said Monday that its work on heavy trucks will continue. GM will still be part of a global supply agreement that would integrate GM\u2019s Hydrotec fuel-cell system into Nikola\u2019s commercial semi-trucks.</p>\n<p>\u201cHeavy trucks remain our core business and we are 100% focused on hitting our development milestones to bring clean hydrogen and battery-electric commercial trucks to market,\u201d said CEO Mark Russell. </p>\n<p>Nikola is based in Phoenix. </p>"

                "body": "<p>MADISON, Wis. (AP) \u2014 Joe Biden\u2019s victory in battleground Wisconsin was certified Monday following a partial recount that only added to his 20,600-vote margin over President Donald Trump, who has promised to file a lawsuit seeking to undo the results.</p>\n<p>Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, signed a certificate that completed the process after the canvass report showing Biden as the winner following the recount was approved by the chairwoman of the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission. Evers\u2019 signature was required by law and is typically a procedural step that receives little attention.</p>\n<p>\u201cToday I carried out my duty to certify the November 3rd election,\u201d Evers said in a statement. \u201cI want to thank our clerks, election administrators, and poll workers across our state for working tirelessly to ensure we had a safe, fair, and efficient election. Thank you for all your good work.\u201d </p>\n<p>The action Monday now starts a five-day deadline for Trump to file a lawsuit, which he promised would come no later than Tuesday. Trump is mounting a longshot attempt to overturn the results by disqualifying as many as 238,000 ballots. Trump\u2019s attorneys have alleged without evidence that there was widespread fraud and illegal activity.</p>\n<p>Biden\u2019s campaign has said the recount showed that Biden won Wisconsin decisively and there was no fraud. Even if Trump were successful in Wisconsin, the state\u2019s 10 Electoral College votes would not be enough to undo Biden\u2019s overall victory as states around the country certify results. Earlier Monday, Arizona officials certified Biden\u2019s narrow victory in that state.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no basis at all for any assertion that there was widespread fraud that would have affected the results,\u201d Wisconsin\u2019s Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul said in a statement Monday. He noted that Trump\u2019s recount targeted only the state\u2019s two most populous counties where the majority of Black people live.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have every confidence that this disgraceful Jim Crow strategy for mass disenfranchisement of voters will fail,\u201d Kaul said. \u201cAn election isn\u2019t a game of gotcha.\u201d</p>\n<p>State law gives the power to confirm the election results to the chair of the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission. The position rotates between Republicans and Democrats and is currently held by Ann Jacobs, a Democrat. She signed the canvass statement certifying Biden as the winner over objections from Republicans who wanted to wait until after legal challenges were exhausted.</p>\n<p>Under state law, the elections staff next sent a certificate to Evers to sign and send to the U.S. administrator of general services \u2014 a procedural step since the law says the governor \u201cshall sign\u201d it. Evers did so about an hour after the canvassed results were confirmed.</p>\n<p>Trump\u2019s legal challenges have failed in other battleground states, including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania. Two lawsuits from others seeking to disqualify ballots in Wisconsin were filed last week with the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which has not taken action.</p>\n<p>Trump paid $3 million for recounts in Dane and Milwaukee counties, the two largest Democratic counties in Wisconsin, but the recount ended up increasing Biden\u2019s lead by 74 votes. Biden won statewide by nearly 20,700 votes.</p>\n<p>Trump, during the recount, sought to have ballots discarded where election clerks filled in missing address information on the certification envelope where the ballot is inserted. The state elections commission told clerks before the election that they could fill in missing information on the absentee ballot envelopes, a practice that has been in place for at least the past 11 elections and that no court has ever ruled illegal.</p>\n<p>Trump also challenged any absentee ballot where a voter declared themselves to be \u201cindefinitely confined\u201d under the law, a designation that increased from about 57,000 in 2016 to nearly 216,000 this year due to the pandemic. Such a declaration exempts the voter from having to show a photo identification to cast a ballot, which Trump attorney Christ Troupis called \u201can open invitation for fraud and abuse.\u201d The conservative-controlled Wisconsin Supreme Court this spring ruled that it is up to individual voters to determine whether they are indefinitely confined, in line with guidance from the state elections commission.</p>\n<p>Trump also sought to discard any absentee ballot where there was not a written application on file and all absentee ballots cast in-person during the two weeks before Election Day.</p>\n<p>People who vote in-person early fill out a certification envelope that they then place their ballot in and that envelope serves as the written record. But the vast majority of absentee requests these days are made online, with a voter\u2019s name entered into an electronic log with no paper record. </p>\n<p>Disqualifying all of the ballots in Milwaukee and Dane counties that Trump identified during the recount would result in more than 238,000 votes not counting, according to an analysis by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.</p>\n<p>The conservative Wisconsin Voters Alliance sued last week seeking to block certification of the results and give the Republican-controlled Legislature the power to appoint presidential electors to cast the state\u2019s 10 Electoral College votes. The Wisconsin Democratic Party previously selected Biden\u2019s 10 electors as prescribed by law. The signing of the canvass statement on Monday confirmed that Biden receives the state\u2019s 10 Electoral College votes from those electors. </p>\n<p>Another lawsuit filed over the weekend by Wisconsin resident Dean Mueller argues that ballots placed in drop boxes are illegal and must not be counted.</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>This story has been corrected to show the recount increased Biden\u2019s margin by 74 votes, not 87, based on corrected totals issued earlier Monday by Dane County.</p>"

Defensive back Iman Marshall was also activated, although he\u2019s been on IR since tearing his right ACL in August.</p>\n<p>The contest pitting two longtime rivals was originally scheduled for Thanksgiving night before a rash of coronavirus cases among the Ravens forced the game to be postponed to Sunday. As Baltimore continued to stack up positive tests, the game was moved back to Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>Now, perhaps, they\u2019ll finally meet on Wednesday in Pittsburgh. </p>\n<p>The Ravens (6-4) will face Pittsburgh (10-0) without several of their top playmakers, including Jackson, Andrews, and defensive linemen Calais Campbell and Brandon Williams.</p>\n<p>The loss of Andrews and Snead will further hinder backup quarterback Robert Griffin III, who will be taking snaps from a third-string center after Patrick Mekari and Matt Skura were placed on the COVID-19 list on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Andrews is a Type-1 diabetic, which makes COVID-19 potentially more dangerous. His loss should have an impact in that he leads Baltimore in receptions (38), yards receiving (454) and touchdown catches (6).</p>\n<p>Andrews, Judon, Jackson, Ingram, Campbell, fullback Patrick Ricard and long snapper Morgan Cox were all selected to the Pro Bowl last season.</p>\n<p>Judon owns Baltimore\u2019s franchise tag.

Tens of thousands of people marched Saturday in Paris to reject the measure, including families and friends of people killed by police.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor decades, descendants of post-colonial immigration and residents in populous neighborhoods have denounced police brutality,\u201d Sihame Assbague, an anti-racism activist, told The Associated Press. </p>\n<p>Videos by the public have helped to show a wider audience that there is a \u201csystemic problem with French police forces, who are abusing, punching, beating, mutilating, killing,\u201d she said. </p>\n<p>Activists say the bill may have an even greater impact on people other than journalists, especially those of immigrant origin living in neighborhoods where relationships with the police have long been tense. Images posted online have been key to denouncing cases of officers\u2019 misconduct and racism in recent years, they argue.</p>\n<p>Assbague expressed fears that, under the proposed law, those who post videos of police abuses online may be put on trial, where they would face up to a year in jail and a 45,000-euro ($53,000) fine. </p>\n<p>\u201cI tend to believe that a young Arab man from a poor suburb who posts a video of police brutality in his neighborhood will be more at risk of being found guilty than a journalist who did a video during a protest,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>Amal Bentounsi\u2019s brother, Amine, was shot in the back and killed by a police officer in 2012. The officer was sentenced to a five-year suspended prison sentence. Along with other families of victims, in March she launched a mobile phone app called Emergency-Police Violence to record abuses and bring cases to court. </p>\n<p>\u201cSome police officers already have a sense of impunity. ... The only solution now is to make videos,\u201d she told the AP. The app has been downloaded more than 50,000 times.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf we want to improve public confidence in the police, it does not go through hiding the truth,\u201d she added.</p>\n<p>The proposed law is partly a response to demands from police unions, who say it will provide greater protection for officers.</p>\n<p>Abdoulaye Kante, a Black police officer with 20 years of experience in Paris and its suburbs, is both a supporter of the proposed law and strongly condemns police brutality and violence against officers.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat people don\u2019t understand is that some individuals are using videos to put the faces of our (police) colleagues on social media so that they are identified, so that they are threatened or to incite hatred,\u201d he said. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe law doesn\u2019t ban journalists or citizens from filming police in action ... It bans these images from being used to harm, physically or psychologically,\u201d he argued. \u201cThe lives of officers are important.\u201d</p>\n<p>A \u201ctiny fraction of the population feeds rage and hatred\u201d against police, Jean-Michel Fauvergue, a former head of elite police forces and a lawmaker in Macron\u2019s party who co-authored the bill, said in the National Assembly. \u201cWe need to find a solution.\u201d</p>\n<p>Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti has acknowledged that \u201cthe intent (to harm) is something that is difficult to define.\u201d</p>\n<p>In an effort to quell criticism, lawmakers from Macron\u2019s party announced Monday they would rewrite the criticized article of the bill, which will be debated by the Senate early next year.</p>\n<p>Activists consider the draft law just the latest of several security measures to extend police powers at the expense of civil liberties. A statement signed by over 30 groups of families and friends of victims of police abuses said since 2005, \u201call security laws adopted have constantly expanded the legal field allowing police impunity.\u201d</p>\n<p>Riots in 2005 exposed France\u2019s long-running problems between police and youths in public housing projects with large immigrant populations. </p>\n<p>In recent years, numerous security laws have been passed following attacks by extremists.</p>\n<p>Critics noted a hardening of police tactics during protests or while arresting individuals. Hundreds of complaints have been filed against officers during the yellow vest movement against economic injustice, which erupted in 2018 and saw weekends of violent clashes. </p>\n<p>Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said out of 3 million police operations per year in France, some 9,500 end up on a government website that denounces abuses, which represents 0.3%.</p>\n<p>France\u2019s human rights ombudsman, Claire Hedon, is among the most prominent critics of the proposed law, which she said involves \u201csignificant risks of undermining fundamental rights.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOur democracy is hit when the population does not trust its police anymore,\u201d she told the National Assembly. </p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>AP writer John Leicester contributed from Le Pecq, France.</p>\n<p>___ </p>\n<p>Follow all AP stories on racism and police brutality at https://apnews.com/Racialinjustice</p>"

                "body": "<p>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 California could see a tripling of hospitalizations by Christmas and is considering stay-home orders for areas with the highest case rates as it tries to head off concerns that severe coronavirus cases could overwhelm intensive care beds, officials said Monday.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe red flags are flying in terms of the trajectory in our projections of growth,\u201d said Gov. Gavin Newsom. \u201cIf these trends continue, we\u2019re going to have to take much more dramatic, arguably drastic, action.\u201d </p>\n<p>Hospitalizations have increased 89% over the past 14 days and nearly 7,800 coronavirus patients were hospitalized as of Monday. About 12% of Californians testing positive are likely to need hospital care within the next two to three weeks.</p>\n<p>The biggest concern is intensive care cases, which have increased 67% in the past two weeks. If that continues, it would push ICU beds to 112% of capacity by mid-December.</p>\n<p>That statistic is likely to drive decisions over whether to impose state-mandated stay-at-home orders in 51 of California\u2019s 58 counties that already are seeing the most restrictions on business activities, said Dr. Mark Ghaly, the state\u2019s secretary of health and human services.</p>\n<p>ICU hospitalization rates vary by county and region, he said, and is a greater concern than overall hospital capacity.</p>\n<p>\u201cBottom line is we are looking at intensive care unit capacity as the primary trigger for deeper, more restrictive actions,\u201d Ghaly said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen that capacity goes away, or even when it gets stretched so far that staffing is stretched, that we have to set up space that isn\u2019t typically used for intensive care units, we know that the quality of care ... sometimes takes a dip and we see outcomes we don\u2019t want to see,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>By the second half of December California \u201ccould be pushing the limits in some areas,\u201d Ghaly said, adding that \u201cwe want to act sooner than that so we can get transmission down and we can handle those potential high ICU surges.\u201d </p>\n<p>Carmela Coyle, president and CEO of the California Hospital Association, said the current rise in cases \u201ccan\u2019t be described as anything other than alarming.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are concerned that those needs will outstrip in particular the staff we have available to care for people in the intensive care units,\u201d Coyle said. \u201cThat is where the most critically ill COVID-19 patients are cared for. That is where the life and death circumstances occur.\u201d</p>\n<p>Santa Clara County Health Officer Dr. Sara Cody over the weekend similarly said she fears hospitals in her county could be overwhelmed within three weeks, given that it has the highest case rate in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>\n<p>Los Angeles County, the nation\u2019s most populous and home to 10 million residents, already imposed its own stay-home order starting Monday. It banned most gatherings but stopped short of a full shutdown on retail stores and other nonessential businesses.</p>\n<p>\u201cA continued surge in cases is just not sustainable,\u201d said county Health Director Barbara Ferrer, repeating concerns that rising cases could begin to overwhelm the health care industry beginning as early as this week.</p>\n<p>From Nov. 13 to Nov. 26, the average daily number of hospitalizations in LA County spiked 93%. The county reported 5,150 newly confirmed cases on Monday, figures that Ferrer called \u201cextraordinarily high.\u201d</p>\n<p>Newsom put out a new call for retired medical professionals to join the volunteer California Health Corps, and said the state may soon be using tents and other makeshift hospitals to help deal with the surge. Nearly 900 people are part of the corps, only 10 of whom are supporting skilled nursing facilities and hospitals, said Rodger Butler, a spokesman for the California Health and Human Services Agency. </p>\n<p>Just 1 of the 11 \u201csurge hospitals\u201d is currently operating: a medical tent set up at Imperial Valley College in hard-hit Imperial County. It had 15 patients in 20 available beds Monday, but could quickly ramp up to handle 115 patients. The other temporary facilities could also begin operating quickly if they are needed.</p>\n<p>With businesses already suffering, more shutdowns on the horizon, and no imminent help from Congress, Newsom and state legislative leaders announced several steps aimed at helping small business owners survive until the federal and state governments can act more broadly early next year.</p>\n<p>They include an automatic three-month extension for those reporting less than $1 million in sales tax; interest-free payments for companies with up to $5 million in sales tax; and $500 million in grants of up to $25,000 each available to small businesses.</p>\n<p>Businesses can also begin applying Tuesday for a Main Street Hiring Tax Credit, which allows $100 million in tax credits.</p>\n<p>Still, with many businesses already imperiled, Newport Beach Mayor Will O\u2019Neill urged caution as the state considers new restrictions. </p>\n<p>\u201cTens of thousands of small businesses and schools have lived up to our community expectations by investing heavily in customer and student safety,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI hope that the Governor\u2019s office recognizes their efforts by using a scalpel and not a hammer.\u201d </p>\n<p>___ Associated Press writer Amy Taxin contributed to this story from Orange County.</p>"

The recording of the July 2018 conversation was made and released to CNN by Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, who was fired from the White House earlier that year. </p>\n<p>Wolkoff published a tell-all book about her friendship and breakup with Mrs. Trump, whom Wolkoff blames for not defending her after questions arose about spending for Trump\u2019s 2017 inauguration, which Wolkoff helped produce. </p>\n<p>This year some 125 volunteers from around the country used 62 trees, 106 wreaths, more than 1,200 feet (366 meters) of garland, more than 3,200 strands of lights and 17,000 bows to decorate the 132-room White House over the course of Thanksgiving weekend.</p>\n<p>The library is decorated to recognize the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, giving women the right to vote. Stockings for the president, first lady and their 14-year-old son Barron hang from a fireplace in the room where presidential china patterns are displayed.</p>\n<p>After previewing the decorations for the media, the White House on Monday planned the first of many holiday receptions that are expected to be smaller in size given coronavirus concerns.</p>\n<p>A few miles north of the White House, the wrapping also came off the Christmas decorations at Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s official residence on the grounds of the Naval Observatory. </p>\n<p>Karen Pence said \u201cOld Fashioned Christmas\u201d is their theme.

Public-health experts believe others who are infected don\u2019t show signs of carrying the virus.</p>\n<p>Previous holidays including Memorial Day, July 4 and Labor Day were followed by increases in new cases.

You don\u2019t need a surge for it to become horrible. The health care systems are already stretched.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious-disease expert, said Sunday that the U.S. could see \u201csurge upon a surge\u201d of coronavirus cases, and he does not expect guidelines advising against travel to be relaxed before Christmas.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s unclear whether the pleas of experts like Fauci had any effect on travel and large gatherings at Thanksgiving.

Experts on epidemics say even if that is true, travelers can spread the virus once they get off the plane. </p>\n<p>Before the latest surge in infections, airlines had added more flights for Thanksgiving, hoping for the same kind of boost in travel they saw over the July 4 and Labor Day holidays. They ended up canceling some of those flights, however, and demand is expected to fall back in early December before another potential pick-up in travel around Christmas.</p>\n<p>Over a 10-day period ending Sunday, TSA screened about 975,000 people a day on average.

                "body": "<p>NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Major League Baseball is creating a minor league for top eligible prospects leading to the summer draft.</p>\n<p>The wood-bat MLB Draft League is launching with five teams and could add a sixth, MLB said Monday. Teams will play a 68-game regular season that includes an All-Star break coinciding with the draft in early July.</p>\n<p>MLB also announced that the eight-team Pioneer League will lose its affiliated status and become an independent \u201cPartner League.\u201d MLB has pledged to provide initial funding for operating expenses and will install scouting technology at league stadiums. The Pioneer League spans Colorado, Idaho, Montana and Utah and had been a Rookie-level affiliated league since 1964.</p>\n<p>Teams in the MLB Draft League are going to communities that lost franchises when MLB began shrinking the affiliated minor leagues from 160 to 120 teams. The reduction this offseason followed the expiration of the Professional Baseball Agreement, which governed the relationship between the majors and minors. MLB has planned to eliminate the separate governing body of minor league baseball.</p>\n<p>The founding members of the MLB Draft League are located in Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and New Jersey: the Mahoning Valley Scrappers, the State College Spikes, the Trenton Thunder, the West Virginia Black Bears and the Williamsport Crosscutters. MLB said it is in discussions with a sixth team that it hopes to announce soon.</p>\n<p>The season will run roughly from late May through mid-August, broken into halves. The first half will be a showcase for draft-eligible high school, college and junior college players. Following a multiday break for the draft, rosters will be restocked with the best players passed over by MLB teams who are still interested in signing.</p>\n<p>The start of the season will overlap with the College World Series, meaning some top players won\u2019t be able to join until after opening day, similar to other college summer leagues like the Cape Cod League.</p>\n<p>MLB\u2019s push to shrink the minors had drawn criticism from many in minor league communities, including politicians. A trio of U.S. senators \u2014 Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia \u2014 praised the MLB Draft League as a way to keep high-level baseball in their communities.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m glad that MLB listened,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThe formation of the MLB Draft League is good news for baseball and for fans in the (Mahoning) Valley, who will get to continue to see high-level prospects in their own backyard and rally around the Scrappers again soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy announced the \u201cTrenton Thunder is saved\u201d during a COVID-19 press briefing Monday.</p>\n<p>The draft league will be operated by Prep Baseball Report \u2014 a scouting, events and media organization focused on youth ball \u2014 and former Cape Cod League coach Kerrick Jackson has been appointed president.</p>\n<p>MLB said in a statement that players will \u201creceive unprecedented visibility to MLB club scouts through both in-person observation and state-of-the-art scouting technology, and educational programming designed to prepare them for careers as professional athletes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Morgan Sword, MLB\u2019s executive vice president of baseball economics and operations, called the venture a \u201cone-of-a-kind league\u201d that will allow fans to \u201csee top prospects and future big-league stars in their hometowns.\u201d He added that MLB is committed to \u201cpreserving and growing baseball in communities around the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p>MLB announced in September that the Appalachian League, formerly a Rookie-level affiliated league, would be transformed into a wood-bat college summer league.</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>Follow Jake Seiner: https://twitter.com/Jake_Seiner</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports</p>"

But the one-time elite political fundraiser Zuberi has pleaded guilty to campaign finance and foreign lobbying violations and now faces several years in prison. </p>\n<p>The Associated Press  investigated Zuberi\u2019s rise and fall in politics using court records, private emails and interviews with dozens of Zuberi associates. </p>\n<p>Key takeaways from the AP\u2019s investigation: </p>\n<p>\u2014 Zuberi used an unsophisticated straw donor scheme in which he paid for others\u2019 donations with his credit cards and used cutouts that included a dead person and names of people prosecutors say he made up. At the same time, prosecutors say Zuberi worked for years as an unregistered foreign agent for at least a half dozen countries and officials, including Turkey and a Ukrainian oligarch close to Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>\n<p>\u2014 The AP\u2019s investigation found several instances where Zuberi-linked donations to members of Congress occurred within a few weeks or even days of him receiving something he sought in return. His donations also gave Zuberi first-name access to members of Congress who controlled foreign policy. He was exceptionally close with outgoing House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Rep. Eliot Engel, who gave Zuberi early heads-ups on legislation he intended to file and shared other details that could be useful to him, the emails show.</p>\n<p>\u2014 There is an ongoing investigation into Zuberi\u2019s ties to Qatar, a probe which has not been previously revealed. Prosecutors said in recent sentencing memos that Zuberi secretly lobbied the White House and Congress on behalf of the small gas-rich monarchy that has paid him $9.8 million. </p>\n<p>\u2014 The AP\u2019s investigation found that Zuberi regularly exchanged encrypted messages with a West Coast-based CIA officer. Zuberi has secretly petitioned a judge to credit him for law enforcement leads and intelligence he says he\u2019s provided to the federal government, according to people familiar with the sealed court records.</p>\n<p>\u2014 Zuberi used his extensive ties to U.S. elected officials to pass on potentially useful information to foreign officials, including information related to Biden. After having coffee with the then-vice president at a Beverly Hills hotel in 2014, Zuberi told the Saudi ambassador that Biden had made derogatory comments about the country, according to private emails. A Biden spokesperson said Zuberi\u2019s emails misrepresent and embellish the interactions he had with the sitting vice president.</p>"

The Census Bureau is supposed to send the data to Trump by Dec. 31.</p>\n<p>But Wall told the court Monday, \u201cWe are not currently on pace to send the report to the president by the year-end statutory deadline.\u201d He said census officials told him they hope some data is available in January.</p>\n<p>A delay of even three weeks would mean the Census Bureau would be turning in the numbers to a new president. President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20.</p>\n<p>Several conservative justices suggested that the better course for the court would be to avoid ruling immediately on lawsuits filed by New York and other Democratic-led states as well as immigration advocates because Trump\u2019s intentions are speculative at this point.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Ho, if the additional information would be beneficial in a few weeks, wouldn\u2019t it be beneficial to actually resolving this case? As the questioning seems to suggest, there\u2019s some difficulty in assessing exactly what information will be available and what that information will be,\u201d Justice Clarence Thomas said to Dale Ho, the American Civil Liberties Union lawyer representing immigration groups.</p>\n<p>The court could simply sit on the case in front of it to see what happens, or dismiss it as premature. The second option would allow Trump to move forward with his plan and lead inevitably to a new lawsuit.</p>\n<p>Trump has a mixed record at the high court on immigration. The justices upheld his ban on travel to the U.S. by residents of some largely Muslim countries. But the court shot down his attempt to end the DACA program and blocked his bid to add a citizenship question to the census for the first time in 70 years.</p>"

Far from accepting Abiy\u2019s declaration of victory, the Tigray leader asserted that \u201cwe are sure we\u2019ll win.\u201d</p>\n<p>He also accused the Ethiopian forces of carrying out a \u201cgenocidal campaign\u201d against the Tigray people. With the Tigray region still cut off a month after the fighting began, no one knows how many people have been killed, and it\u2019s difficult to verify the warring sides\u2019 claims. </p>\n<p>Each government regards the other as illegal after Abiy sidelined the once-dominant Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front after taking office in early 2018.</p>\n<p>The fight is about self-determination of the region of around 6 million people, the Tigray leader said, and it \u201cwill continue until the invaders are out.\u201d He asserted that his forces held an undetermined number of \u201ccaptives\u201d among the Ethiopian forces, including the pilot of a fighter jet that his side claims to have shot down over the weekend.</p>\n<p>The Tigray leader also asserted that his forces still have several missiles and \u201cwe can use them whenever we want,\u201d though he rejected a question about striking at the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, saying the primary aim is to \u201cclear Tigray from the invaders.\u201d He again accused Abiy of collaborating with neighboring Eritrea in the offensive in Tigray, something the Ethiopian government has denied.</p>\n<p>As for the idea of talks with the government, something Abiy has repeatedly rejected, the Tigray leader said that \u201cdepends on the content\u201d and Ethiopian forces would first have to leave the region.</p>\n<p>\u201cCivilian casualties are so high,\u201d he said, though he denied having any estimate of the toll. He accused Ethiopian forces of \u201clooting wherever they go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe suffering is greater and greater every day,\u201d he said, calling it collective punishment against the Tigray people for their belief in their leaders.</p>\n<p>The fighting has threatened to destabilize Ethiopia, the linchpin of the strategic Horn of Africa, and its neighbors. </p>\n<p>Abiy in remarks to lawmakers on Monday asserted that \u201cthe defense force has not killed a single person in any city. No nation\u2019s military could have shown better competency than us.\u201d But one of his own cabinet ministers, Zadig Abraha, told the AP on Saturday that \u201cwe have kept the civilian casualty very low.\u201d</p>\n<p>U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke with Abiy on Monday \u2014 the first known time since the fighting began \u2014 and reiterated the \u201cgrave concern regarding ongoing hostilities and the risks the conflict poses,\u201d a spokesman said. Pompeo also \u201ccalled for a complete end to the fighting and constructive dialogue to resolve the crisis\u201d and for humanitarian access and protection of civilians, including refugees. </p>\n<p>U.N.

Food is also running low, the result of the region being cut off from outside aid.</p>\n<p>In a rare report from inside Mekele, the ICRC also said a major hospital in northern Ethiopia, Ayder Referral Hospital, is lacking body bags and some 80% of its patients have trauma injuries. </p>\n<p>Fears of a widespread humanitarian disaster are growing. The U.N. has been unable to access the Tigray region. Human rights groups and others worry about the atrocities that might emerge once transport and other links are restored. </p>\n<p>Nearly 1 million people have been displaced, including about 44,000 who fled into Sudan. Camps in Tigray that are home to 96,000 Eritrean refugees have been in the line of fire. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe need first and foremost access\u201d to Tigray, U.N. refugee chief Filippo Grandi said Sunday, adding that his U.N. colleagues in Addis Ababa are in discussions with the government. Abiy\u2019s government has promised a \u201chumanitarian corridor\u201d managed by itself, but the U.N. has stressed the importance of neutrality.</p>\n<p>The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission on Monday urged the government to quickly restore basic services and humanitarian aid access to the Tigray region and allow access to independent investigations into \u201cgrave human rights violations.\u201d It also expressed concern about profiling of ethnic Tigrayans.</p>"

Others, such as Debenhams, Edinburgh Woollen Mill and Oasis Warehouse have all slid into insolvency since lockdown measures were first imposed in March. </p>\n<p>Analysts have said that the pandemic hasn\u2019t been solely behind Arcadia\u2019s woes. For years, Arcadia has struggled to respond to the increased competition from low-cost rivals like Primark, as well as from online disrupters such as ASOS and Boohoo. </p>\n<p>Critics have also said that the 68-year-old Green, who has been embroiled in a series of controversies over the past few years, hasn\u2019t invested enough in the businesses to get them in shape to deal with the new competition in retail.</p>\n<p>\u201cArcadia has suffered against these emerging players because the company was slow to develop an innovative and user-friendly online offering as well as a strong brand narrative and social media presence,\u201d said Nina Marston, fashion and luxury analyst at Euromonitor International.</p>\n<p>There was no immediate announcement of layoffs or store closures.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe will be rapidly seeking expressions of interest and expect to identify one or more buyers to ensure the future success of the businesses,\u201d said Matt Smith, joint administrator at Deloitte. </p>\n<p>Smith said the intention is that all the brands will continue to trade when stores are allowed to reopen in England on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>England is in a four-week lockdown that has forced the closure of all shops selling items deemed to be non-essential.

Though Green subsequently paid hundreds of millions into the pension, his reputation never recovered. Chappell, meanwhile, was this month sentenced to six years in jail for tax evasion during his time running BHS.</p>\n<p>Earlier on Monday, Frasers Group, which is run by Green\u2019s long-time rival Mike Ashley, said an offer for a 50 million-pound lifeline for Arcadia was rejected and lawmakers sought to ensure that Arcadia\u2019s pension scheme was protected.

He also announced total weekend lockdowns from 9:00 pm on Friday to 5:00 am on Monday.</p>\n<p>With strong pressure from the medical community and the public, Turkey last week resumed reporting all positive tests for the virus, after releasing only the number of symptomatic cases for four months. That caused daily cases to shoot up to around 30,000 and put Turkey among the hardest-hit nations in Europe during the pandemic.</p>\n<p>Health Ministry statistics on Monday showed 31,219 confirmed new infections and 188 new deaths. Daily fatalities in Turkey have hit record numbers for eight consecutive days, bringing the country\u2019s acknowledged virus death toll to 13,746. </p>\n<p>The new curfews begin Tuesday. Sectors including production, logistics, health care, agriculture and forestry would be exempt from the curfews, while grocery stores and food delivery services would be allowed to operate within certain hours during the weekend lockdowns. </p>\n<p>In the spring, Turkey instituted temporary weekend and holiday lockdowns to fight the spread of COVID-19, but current infections and deaths have surged beyond the spring numbers. Weekend night curfews for the past two weeks have done little to curb people\u2019s movements, with Turkish media showing packed public spaces. </p>\n<p>The Turkish Medical Association, which has been critical of the government\u2019s policies and has called for more transparency since March, said 20 health care workers died in one week from COVID-19 complications. ICU bed occupation was around 71%, according to the health ministry. </p>\n<p>Erdogan also announced that people above 65 or younger than 20, who are allowed out for only three hours a day, would not be allowed to use public transport, mall-goers would have to use a contact tracing code, and weddings and funerals would be limited to 30 people. Provincial health authorities would be able to mandate limits on the number of people in malls, bazaars and public spaces like avenues and squares. </p>\n<p>Erdogan also urged people to quit smoking, open their windows, abide by mask-wearing guidelines and social distancing. </p>\n<p>Preschools, Turkish baths, saunas, massage parlors, swimming pools and amusement parks were ordered to close. Restaurants would only be able to deliver food, annulling a previous measure that also allowed takeout services.</p>\n<p>The president also promised that 50 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine would be administered free of charge, starting with health care workers next month, following an agreement with the Chinese pharmaceutical company SinoVac. </p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>Follow AP\u2019s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak</p>"

Doug Ducey both vouched for the integrity of the election before signing off on the results. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe do elections well here in Arizona. The system is strong,\u201d Ducey said. </p>\n<p>He did not directly address Trump\u2019s claims of irregularities but said the state pulled off a successful election with a mix of in-person and mail voting despite the pandemic. </p>\n<p>Hobbs said Arizona voters should know that the election \u201cwas conducted with transparency, accuracy and fairness in accordance with Arizona\u2019s laws and election procedures, despite numerous unfounded claims to the contrary.\u201d</p>\n<p>Biden is only the second Democrat in 70 years to win Arizona. In the final tally, he beat Trump by 10,457 votes, or 0.3 percent of the nearly 3.4 million ballots cast. Eleven Democratic electors will meet Dec. 14 to formally cast Arizona\u2019s electoral votes for Biden. </p>\n<p>Even as Hobbs, Ducey, the state attorney general and chief justice of the state Supreme Court certified the election results, Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis met in a Phoenix hotel ballroom a few miles away to lay out claims of irregularities in the vote count in Arizona and elsewhere. But they did not provide evidence of widespread fraud. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe officials certifying have made no effort to find out the truth, which to me, gives the state Legislature the perfect reason to take over the conduct of this election because it\u2019s being conducted irresponsibly and unfairly,\u201d Giuliani said.</p>\n<p>Nine Republican state lawmakers attended the meeting. They had requested permission to hold a formal legislative hearing at the Capitol but were denied by the Republican House speaker and Senate president. </p>\n<p>Elections challenges brought by the Trump campaign or his backers in key battleground states have largely been unsuccessful as Trump continues to allege voter fraud while refusing to concede.</p>\n<p>There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election. In fact, election officials from both political parties have stated publicly that the election went well and international observers confirmed there were no serious irregularities.</p>\n<p>A judge in Phoenix has scheduled a Thursday trial in Arizona GOP Chairwoman Kelli Ward\u2019s lawsuit that seeks to annul Biden\u2019s victory in the state. </p>\n<p>The lawsuit against Biden\u2019s 11 electors in Arizona asks for an inspection of mail-in ballot signatures and duplicated ballots in metro Phoenix, home to 61 percent of Arizona\u2019s voters.</p>\n<p>Judge Randall Warner is letting Ward\u2019s lawyers and experts compare the signatures on 100 mail-in ballot envelopes with signatures on file to determine whether there were any irregularities. </p>\n<p>Hobbs\u2019 office has said there was no factual basis for such a review. Under questioning from Warner, Ward\u2019s attorney, Jack Wilenchik, said Congress would decide the presidential contest if the results are annulled by the court.</p>\n<p>Last week, another judge in Phoenix rejected the Arizona Republican Party\u2019s bid to postpone the certification of election results in Maricopa County \u2014 which encompasses Phoenix and is the state\u2019s most populous \u2014 and dismissed the party\u2019s legal challenge that sought a new audit of a sampling of ballots.</p>\n<p>The certification also paved the way for Democrat Mark Kelly to take his seat in the U.S. Senate, formalizing his victory in a special election to finish the last two years of the term of John McCain, who died in 2018. Kelly is scheduled to be sworn in on Wednesday in Washington. </p>\n<p>The GOP\u2019s Senate majority will fall to 52 members when Kelly replaces Republican Martha McSally, who was appointed to McCain\u2019s seat but lost to Kelly in the election. </p>\n<p>Control of the next Senate will come down to two runoff elections in Georgia. If Democrats win both, the Senate would be split 50-50, and incoming Vice President Kamala Harris would cast tie-breaking votes. </p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>Associated Press writer Jacques Billeaud in Phoenix contributed to this report.</p>"

                "byline": "By NASSER KARIMI and JON GAMBRELL",
                "body": "<p>TEHRAN, Iran (AP) \u2014 A top Iranian security official on Monday accused Israel of using \u201celectronic devices\u201d to remotely kill a scientist who founded the Islamic Republic\u2019s military nuclear program in the 2000s. </p>\n<p>Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of the country\u2019s Supreme National Security Council, made the comment at the funeral for Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, where Iran\u2019s defense minister separately vowed to continue the man\u2019s work \u201cwith more speed and more power.\u201d</p>\n<p>Israel, long suspected of killing Iranian nuclear scientists over the last decade, has repeatedly declined to comment on the attack. </p>\n<p>Fakhrizadeh headed Iran\u2019s so-called AMAD program, which Israel and the West have alleged was a military operation looking at the feasibility of building a nuclear weapon. The International Atomic Energy Agency says that \u201cstructured program\u201d ended in 2003. U.S. intelligence agencies concurred with that assessment in a 2007 report.</p>\n<p>Israel insists Iran still maintains the ambition of developing nuclear weapons, pointing to Tehran\u2019s ballistic missile program and research into other technologies. Iran long has maintained that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.</p>\n<p>Shamkhani\u2019s remarks drastically change the story of Fakhrizadeh\u2019s killing, which took place Friday. Authorities initially said a truck exploded and then gunmen opened fire on the scientist, killing him and a bodyguard. State TV even interviewed a man the night of the attack who described seeing gunmen open fire.</p>\n<p>State TV\u2019s English-language broadcaster Press TV reported earlier Monday that a weapon recovered from the scene of the attack bore \u201cthe logo and specifications of the Israeli military industry.\u201d State TV\u2019s Arabic-language channel, Al-Alam, claimed the weapons used were \u201ccontrolled by satellite,\u201d a claim also made Sunday by the semiofficial Fars news agency. </p>\n<p>None of the outlets immediately offered evidence supporting their claims, which also give authorities a way to explain why no one was reportedly arrested at the scene.</p>\n<p>\u201cUnfortunately, the operation was a very complicated operation and was carried out by using electronic devices,\u201d Shamkhani told state TV. \u201cNo individual was present at the site.\u201d</p>\n<p>Satellite control of weapons is nothing new. Armed, long-range drones, for instance, rely on satellite connections to be controlled by their remote pilots. Remote-controlled gun turrets also exist, but typically see their operator connected by a hard line to cut down on the delay in commands being relayed. Israel uses such hard-wired systems along the border with the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip. </p>\n<p>While technically feasible, it wasn\u2019t immediately clear if such a system had been used before, said Jeremy Binnie, the Mideast editor of Jane\u2019s Defence Weekly.</p>\n<p>\u201cCould you set up a weapon with a camera which then has a feed that uses an open satellite communications line back to the controller?\u201d Binnie said. \u201cI can\u2019t see why that\u2019s not possible.\u201d</p>\n<p>It also raised the question whether the truck that exploded during the attack detonated afterward to try to destroy a satellite-controlled machine gun that was hidden inside the vehicle. Iranian officials did not immediately acknowledge that. It also would require someone on the ground to set up the weapon.</p>\n<p>Shamkhani blamed the Iranian exile group Mujahedeen-e-Khalq as well for \u201chaving a role in this,\u201d without elaborating. The MEK, as the exile group is known, has been suspected of assisting Israeli operations in Iran in the past. Shahin Gobadi, an MEK spokesman, dismissed Shamkhani\u2019s remarks as \u201crage, rancor and lies\u201d sparked by the group\u2019s earlier exposes over Iran\u2019s nuclear program.</p>\n<p>Monday\u2019s service for Fakhrizadeh took place at an outdoor portion of Iran\u2019s Defense Ministry in Tehran, with officials including Revolutionary Guard chief Gen. Hossein Salami, the Guard\u2019s Quds Force leader Gen. Esmail Ghaani, civilian nuclear program chief Ali Akbar Sahei and Intelligence Minister Mamoud Alavi. They sat apart from each other and wore masks due to the coronavirus pandemic as reciters melodically read parts of the Quran and religious texts.</p>\n<p>Defense Minister Gen. Amir Hatami gave a speech after kissing Fakhrizadeh\u2019s casket and putting his forehead against it. He said Fakhrizadeh\u2019s killing would make Iranians \u201cmore united, more determined.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor the continuation of your path, we will continue with more speed and more power,\u201d Hatami said in comments aired live by state television.</p>\n<p>Hatami also criticized countries that hadn\u2019t condemned Fakhrizadeh\u2019s killing and warned: \u201cThis will catch up with you someday.\u201d </p>\n<p>Overnight, the United Arab Emirates, which just reached a normalization deal with Israel, issued a statement condemning \u201cthe heinous assassination.\u201d The UAE, home to Abu Dhabi and Dubai, warned the killing \u201ccould further fuel conflict in the region.\u201d</p>\n<p>Last year, the UAE found itself in the middle of an escalating series of incidents between Iran and the U.S. Though long suspicious of Iran\u2019s nuclear program, the Emirates has said it wants to de-escalate the crisis. The UAE just started passenger air service to Israel and Israelis are expected to vacation in the country over Hanukkah in the coming days.</p>\n<p>Bahrain, an island kingdom off Saudi Arabia in the Persian Gulf that also recently normalized relations with Israel, similarly condemned Fakhrizadeh\u2019s killing.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn light of the current situation in the region, the kingdom of Bahrain calls on all parties to exercise maximum restraint to avoid new levels of instability,\u201d Bahrain\u2019s Foreign Affairs Ministry said.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Israeli Foreign Ministry Director-General Alon Ushpiz has sent a cable to all Israeli diplomatic delegations around the globe urging diplomats to maintain \u201cthe highest level of readiness and awareness of any irregular activity\u201d around missions and Jewish community centers.</p>\n<p>Hebrew-language media in Israel reported that following the Fakhrizadeh\u2019s killing, the Foreign Ministry ordered security increased at certain Israeli diplomatic missions overseas.

Foreign ambassadors turned to Zuberi to get face time in Congress. A CIA officer called him the \u201cbest connected person I know,\u201d marveling at the depth of his Rolodex.</p>\n<p>He was a charming networker and an inveterate namedropper. His Facebook account was filled with pictures of him next to the powerful and famous: having dinner with Hillary Clinton and Robert De Niro and rubbing shoulders with Trump\u2019s then-chief of staff Reince Priebus outside Mar-A-Lago. Zuberi raised huge amounts for Clinton in the 2016 election before becoming a top donor to the Trump Presidential Inauguration Committee. </p>\n<p>But federal prosecutors say Zuberi\u2019s life was built on a series of lies and the lucrative enterprise of funding American political campaigns and profiting from the resulting influence. </p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone wants to come to Washington to meet people,\u201d Zuberi said in a 2015 email obtained by The Associated Press, seeking a meet-and-greet between the president of Guinea and a powerful congressman. \u201cWe get request(s) for meeting(s) from all scumbag of the world, warlords, kings, queens, presidents for life, military dictators, clan chiefs, tribal chiefs and etc.\u201d </p>\n<p>Prosecutors describe Zuberi as a \u201cmercenary\u201d political donor who gave to anyone \u2014 often using illegal straw donor cutouts \u2014 he thought could help him. Pay to play, he explained to clients, was just \u201chow America work(s).\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuberi\u2019s story underscores how loosely regulated campaign finance and foreign lobbying laws are and raises an embarrassing question: How does such a cynical fraudster find favor with so many officials at the highest levels of the U.S. government? </p>\n<p>\u201cThe Zuberi case explicitly verifies, through evidentiary proof, pervasive, corrupt foreign interference with our elections and policy-making processes,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel J. O\u2019Brien said in a sentencing memo.</p>\n<p>Zuberi pleaded guilty last year to campaign finance violations, failing to register as a foreign agent and tax evasion. He also admitted obstructing a New York-based federal investigation into whether foreign nationals unlawfully contributed to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee. He faces several years in prison and is set to be sentenced early next year.</p>\n<p>But the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s probe has left many unanswered questions about Zuberi\u2019s foreign entanglements and who benefited from his actions. Aside from a minor associate who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor tax charge, no one who assisted Zuberi has been charged.</p>\n<p>And the government has not publicly named the politicians who benefited from Zuberi\u2019s donations and did favors for him. </p>\n<p>But an AP investigation identified associates, enablers and targets of Zuberi\u2019s influence efforts, drawing on private emails, court documents, campaign finance reports, and interviews with more than three dozen people including diplomats, law enforcement officials, lobbyists, and former members of Congress.</p>\n<p>Taken together, they present a fuller picture of Zuberi\u2019s rapid rise and fall in politics and the cracks in the system that allowed it to happen. </p>\n<p>The documents and interviews show Zuberi used an unsophisticated straw donor scheme in which he paid for others\u2019 donations with his credit cards and used cutouts that included a dead person and names of people prosecutors say he made up. The Justice Department said Zuberi, over a five-year period, funneled nearly $1 million in illegal campaign donations, in what law enforcement officials say is one of the largest such schemes ever prosecuted. </p>\n<p>His donations gave Zuberi first-name access to top foreign and American diplomats and well as members of Congress who controlled foreign policy, such as Sens. Bob Casey and Lindsey Graham. Casey and Graham, like many lawmakers who took Zuberi\u2019s money, declined to comment. </p>\n<p>Prosecutors say Zuberi worked for years as an unregistered foreign agent for at least a half dozen countries and officials, including a Ukrainian oligarch close to Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>\n<p>Zuberi also used his extensive ties to U.S. elected officials to pass on potentially useful information to foreign officials, including information related to Biden. He also kept in close contact with a West Coast-based CIA officer and bragged to associates of his ties to the intelligence community. </p>\n<p>Federal prosecutors in Los Angeles have asked U.S. District Judge Virginia Phillips to sentence Zuberi to at least 10 years behind bars at his sentencing on Jan. 7. They also want him to pay a $10 million fine and nearly $16 million restitution to the Internal Revenue Service.</p>\n<p>Zuberi says he deserves a much lighter punishment and disputes the scope of his wrongdoing. The former political fundraiser admits he violated campaign laws by making donations in the names of others but said the amount of illegal donations is lower than what prosecutors claim. </p>\n<p>Zuberi said he \u201chelped facilitate\u201d donations from foreign sources but said federal law in that area is unclear and that he received \u201cconflicting advice from various campaigns\u201d about the legality of such donations. Zuberi admits he did unregistered lobbying for Sri Lanka but said the type of work he did for other countries and officials didn\u2019t require him to register as a foreign agent. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe government really, really wants to make an example of Mr. Zuberi well beyond that merited by his actions,\u201d his lawyers argued in court filings. </p>\n<p>In recent months, Zuberi has secretly petitioned Phillips to credit him for law enforcement leads and intelligence he says he\u2019s provided to the federal government. He contends in sealed court records that he\u2019s given usable national security-related information to multiple agencies, according to people familiar with the records. </p>\n<p>Zuberi\u2019s lawyers did not respond to requests for comment. </p>\n<p>\u201cI KNOW MOST OF THEM ON BOTH SIDES\u201d</p>\n<p>Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has been among the most aggressive foreign officials in trying to shape U.S. foreign policy in recent years, spending heavily on hiring well-connected lobbyists. Other well-known officials like Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn have advanced Erdogan\u2019s interests. </p>\n<p>Zuberi was also in the mix, private emails and court records show. </p>\n<p>Turkey has a poor record on censorship and suppressing free speech and, in 2015, more than 30 House members sponsored a proposed House resolution urging \u201crespect for freedom of expression and human rights in Turkey.\u201d</p>\n<p>Turkey\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., Serdar Kilic, obtained a draft of the resolution before it was filed and asked Zuberi to help kill it, saying in an email that its advancement \u201cwould be extremely counterproductive\u201d before a general election in Turkey. </p>\n<p>Zuberi responded a few hours later saying he thought Erdogan was a hero and would be happy to help Kilic lobby the two most powerful members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee: then-Republican Chairman Ed Royce and Democratic ranking member Eliot Engel.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come to Los Angeles as my guest and I can have you meet both over dinner in private?\u201d Zuberi wrote. \u201cLet me know who else in the Foreign Affairs Committee you need help with? I know most of them on both sides.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuberi was a regular donor and cultivated ties to both congressmen. He was exceptionally close with Engel, who gave Zuberi early heads-ups on legislation he intended to file and shared other details that could be useful to Zuberi, the emails show. </p>\n<p>\u201cI should be filing a Syria bill on either Thursday or Friday. We are also going to file an Iran bill. Again, thank you for everything. I am glad that we agree so much,\u201d Engel said in a 2013 email to Zuberi discussing a campaign fundraiser. </p>\n<p>Zuberi actively lobbied to kill the resolution related to Turkey and was able to flip one of the sponsors, prosecutors said. The legislation died in committee without ever getting a vote. </p>\n<p>Neither Royce, who has retired from Congress, nor Engel, who lost a primary earlier this year, agreed to an interview with the AP but said through spokespeople that Zuberi\u2019s lobbying efforts on Turkey, or any other matter, never had any impact on policy decisions.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable that anyone coming before the committee would ignore laws that deal with lobbying for foreign governments, but nothing at the time seemed unusual about Mr. Zuberi\u2019s requests,\u201d said Engel spokesperson Tim Mulvey. \u201cSetting up meetings isn\u2019t the same as exerting influence.\u201d</p>\n<p>Former U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, the resolution\u2019s lead sponsor, said he had no idea what was going on behind the scenes to kill the resolution. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty shocking,\u201d he told the AP after reading the sentencing memos. </p>\n<p>An internal Trump inaugural document obtained by the AP showed that Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu was listed as one of Zuberi\u2019s guests at a VIP inaugural event, and deleted pictures from his Facebook page show him posing with Cavusoglu and Kilic at a black-tie event around the time of the inauguration. </p>\n<p>Officials from the Turkish embassy did not return requests for comment. </p>\n<p>Prosecutors said in recent filings that Zuberi also secretly lobbied the White House and Congress on behalf of Qatar, a small gas-rich monarchy that has engaged in a multimillion-dollar battle for influence during the Trump administration with its bitter rival, the United Arab Emirates, according to the recent sentencing memos.</p>\n<p>In the memos, prosecutors say Zuberi made $9.8 million from the Qatari government, most of which they said appears to come from illegal lobbying efforts. Law enforcement officials say Zuberi\u2019s lobbying for Qatar is still under investigation \u2014 a probe that has not previously been revealed. They have not released details about his work but said \u201cU.S. policy was changed to align with Qatar\u2019s interests.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuberi accompanied Qatari officials on a trade mission to South Carolina in 2018 as well as Qatar\u2019s foreign minister to Trump Tower in New York in December 2016, a month after Trump won the election. </p>\n<p>Qatar declined to comment. A spokesman for Zuberi at the time, Steve Rabinowitz, told the AP last year that Zuberi was meeting the Qataris elsewhere in Manhattan to discuss investment opportunities when he accompanied them to Trump Tower, but did not attend any meetings there. The White House declined to comment. </p>\n<p>Campaign donations, many of them illegal, were often a key part of Zuberi\u2019s lobbying effort, prosecutors said. He used straw donors to get around campaign donation limits in a scheme that was not particularly well hidden.</p>\n<p>Zuberi used the same address for multiple members of his straw donor network: a nondescript warehouse east of Los Angeles that was home to his sister-in-law\u2019s Chinese herbal medicine and acupuncture supply company. Among the names listed as giving from that address: a Saudi tycoon, a Kuwaiti educator, and a person prosecutors said Zuberi fabricated. Prosecutors said Zuberi frequently used his mother as a straw donor, and campaign records show one donation several months after she died. </p>\n<p>Prosecutors did not name any of the straw donors. The AP identified them through private emails, interviews, and campaign contribution records. </p>\n<p>Sometimes Zuberi would make donations in straw donors\u2019 names but pay for them with his or his wife\u2019s credit card, prosecutors said in charging papers.</p>\n<p>Prosecutors note in sentencing memos that Zuberi donated about $225,000 \u2014 including $78,000 from illegal straw donations \u2014 to lawmakers as he persuaded them to write a letter to Bahrain expressing concern about the Persian Gulf\u2019s country\u2019s \u201charassment\u201d of U.S. investors in that country. </p>\n<p>Prosecutors say in charging documents the letters were part of an elaborate scheme to dupe Congress and to put pressure on the Bahraini government on behalf of Esam Janahi, a businessman who was in a dispute with a high-ranking Bahraini government official. Zuberi\u2019s lawyers said the letters were a \u201ccommon constituent service\u201d that served a legitimate purpose. Prosecutors refer to Janahi only as \u201cPerson J\u201d in their court filings, but the AP was able to identify him through private emails and interviews . Janahi did not return emails seeking comment. </p>\n<p>The 12 members of Congress who wrote the letters are not named in court records. But the AP obtained copies of their letters, which were sent on official congressional letterheads and all used the same talking points. </p>\n<p>Lawmakers who sent letters include Engel; Rep. Karen Bass, who was on the short-list to be Biden\u2019s vice president; Rep. Brad Sherman, who may replace Engel as chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee; and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who was DNC chairman at the time. Bass, Sherman and Wasserman Schultz did not return requests for comment. </p>\n<p>The AP\u2019s investigation found several instances where Zuberi-linked donations to lawmakers occurred within a few weeks or even days of him receiving something he sought in return, like the letters to Bahrain\u2019s government or letters of introductions to U.S. ambassadors overseas.</p>\n<p>Private emails show that, in 2014, Zuberi obtained letters from several congressmen he regularly donated to as part of an effort to oppose a Pakistani wind energy project that was receiving financial support from the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation, a government agency now known as the International Development Finance Corporation, which assists businesses looking to invest abroad. </p>\n<p>A week after Zuberi and his wife gave $10,400 to Texas Rep. Ted Poe\u2019s campaign account, the lawmaker sent a letter to OPIC questioning the wind project and asking to freeze any aid to Pakistan. Poe said he also met with the agency\u2019s director. </p>\n<p>Poe, who left office in 2019, told the AP he had a duty to investigate Zuberi\u2019s claims of corruption related to the wind project and the campaign contributions did not affect his actions. </p>\n<p>\u201cThere was no quid pro quo,\u201d said Poe.</p>\n<p>Sentencing memos and private emails obtained by the AP show that one major aspect of Zuberi\u2019s work was obtaining official letters from members of Congress inviting foreign officials to the U.S. for visits. </p>\n<p>That includes invites for former Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari, who has used visits with top U.S. lawmakers to boost his image back home after he left office in 2013; associates of Dmitry Firtash, a Putin-friendly oligarch fighting extradition to the United States on federal bribery and racketeering charges; and Libyan officials seeking to unfreeze billions of dollars in assets.</p>\n<p>Prosecutors say in sentencing memos that Zuberi made $1 million doing unregistered lobbying for Firtash, which Zuberi said was for legitimate business transactions. A company spokesperson for Firtash did not respond to requests for comment. </p>\n<p>Zuberi also used his extensive ties to American officials to pass on potentially useful information to foreign officials, his emails show. </p>\n<p>Greg Schultz \u2014 then a senior advisor to Biden who at one point served as his 2020 presidential campaign manager \u2014 sent Zuberi an email arranging a Sunday morning coffee with the vice president at a Beverly Hills hotel in 2014. At the meeting, Zuberi pumped Biden for information about his views on Saudi Arabia and its objection to U.S. negotiations with Iran, according to his emails. </p>\n<p>Zuberi then reported back to a Saudi ambassador to the U.S. that Biden said \u201cthe Saudis are whining because they know North America will be energy independent and their usefulness will be greatly diminished for United States.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like he is a fan of Saudi Arabia. We can discuss when we meet,\u201d Zuberi said in an email to then-Saudi Ambassador Adel al-Jubeir.</p>\n<p>Court records include a 2016 text message where Zuberi indicated he was paid handsomely by the Saudis, though no other details are provided. </p>\n<p>\u201cI get million times more from Saudis for doing less than I have done for Turkey,\u201d Zuberi said.</p>\n<p>An official from the Saudi Embassy official said it does not have any \u201cagreement or relationship\u201d with Zuberi and \u201cengages with a broad segment of Americans as a normal part of its activities.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuberi met multiple times with Biden. Topics he says in emails he planned to discuss with the vice president, according to Zuberi\u2019s emails, included Chinese-U.S. relations, a Bahraini development and a potential Biden trip to Pakistan. </p>\n<p>Biden transition spokesperson Andrew Bates confirmed the two men met but said that Zuberi\u2019s meetings with the then-vice president were always \u201cin group settings \u2014 mostly donor roundtables.\u201d Zuberi\u2019s emails misrepresent and embellish his interactions with Biden, who did not have \u201cany way of knowing\u201d about Zuberi\u2019s illicit activities, Bates said. </p>\n<p>\u201cWE MAKE THE BEST WEAPONS IN THE WORLD\u201d</p>\n<p>Prosecutors and Zuberi\u2019s legal team have been feuding for months over his punishment. More than 100 filings have been made under seal, an unheard degree of secrecy for a sentencing fight in a supposedly non-national security case.</p>\n<p>The AP\u2019s investigation found that Zuberi regularly exchanged encrypted messages with a CIA officer, who once expressed amazement at Zuberi\u2019s broad network of contacts. </p>\n<p>It is not clear whether the agency knew of Zuberi\u2019s illicit dealings. A spokesperson for the agency referred questions to the U.S. Justice Department, which did not respond to requests for comment. </p>\n<p>A former foreign diplomat told AP that Zuberi boasted of having \u201chelped the CIA with China\u201d and having \u201csmoothed relations for the ISI,\u201d referring to the Pakistani intelligence agency. The diplomat spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. </p>\n<p>In a 2013 email to a State Department official, Zuberi asked if he could set up meetings with members of Congress for a Libyan intelligence officer who was visiting Washington.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause of the sensitive nature of this request, he needs to be handled through other channels,\u201d David McFarland, a high-ranking State Department official stationed in Libya, responded to the email.</p>\n<p>In his private emails, Zuberi frequently discussed selling U.S. arms abroad.</p>\n<p>In one email, Zuberi asked then-U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan Richard G. Olson for \u201ctalking points\u201d before meeting with lawmakers to discuss a potential arms sale to that country.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe make the best weapons in the world. Per our conversation, I will coordinate our friends from Saudi and Kuwait,\u201d Zuberi said in an 2015 email to Linden Blue, a co-owner of General Atomics, as a deal to sell unarmed versions of the company\u2019s drones to the UAE was nearing final approval. </p>\n<p>In the same email, Zuberi invited Blue over email to dinner with U.S. senators on the armed services committee, which Blue agreed to. \u201cThanks for the note,\u201d Blue replied, before agreeing to dates for the meetings with lawmakers. </p>\n<p>A spokesman for General Atomics said neither Blue nor the company had a business relationship with Zuberi. </p>\n<p>\u201cOVERWHELMING MAJORITY\u201d</p>\n<p>When Zuberi started giving money and rising in the political scene less than a decade ago, prosecutors said he was worth $1.5 million, with an unknown amount coming from foreign sources. </p>\n<p>Currently, prosecutors estimate that his net worth is more than $30 million and said the \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of it came from illegal activity. Prosecutors say that includes stealing from some of his foreign clients, which Zuberi has denied. </p>\n<p>\u201cZuberi\u2019s ability to obtain introductions to wealthy clients, politicians and business associates often began with false representations concerning his pedigree, education, experience, business, investment successes, and financial condition,\u201d prosecutors wrote.</p>\n<p>The Federal Elections Commission has long been mired in partisan gridlock and, until recently, the Justice Department had all but ignored violations of foreign lobbying registration requirements. Between 1966 and 2015 the department brought just seven criminal cases for violating the law related to registering as a foreign lobbyist, according to a 2016 inspector general\u2019s report.</p>\n<p>Political candidates are under constant pressure to raise money and have little incentive to scrutinize donations too closely. And lawmakers say it\u2019s not their job to ensure whoever is lobbying them has properly registered, including major donors like Zuberi. </p>\n<p>A key feature of the Trump era has been a mounting focus on foreign interference in U.S. foreign policy, including multiple investigations of Russia\u2019s high-tech efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.</p>\n<p>But Zuberi\u2019s story shows there are easier ways to try to bend American foreign policy than using sophisticated hacking tools or well-funded troll farms.</p>\n<p>Brendan Fischer, director of federal reform at the Campaign Legal Center, said it\u2019s impossible to know how many other access brokers in Washington are operating like Zuberi and evading detection but said it\u2019s fair to suspect there are many others.</p>\n<p>But, he added, many lobbyists make a lucrative living operating like Zuberi out in the open \u2014 without having to break any laws. </p>\n<p>\u201cIf Zuberi was willing to comply with the minimal, basic transparency requirements in law and just knew more rich people who might have given more money to politicians in response to solicitations, he might have been able to do this in a lawful way,\u201d Fischer said. </p>\n<p>__</p>\n<p>Suderman reported from Richmond and McLean, Virginia.

                "body": "<p>Moderna Inc. said Monday it was asking U.S. and European regulators to allow emergency use of its COVID-19 vaccine as new study results confirm the shots offer strong protection \u2014 intensifying the race to begin limited vaccinations as the coronavirus rampage worsens.</p>\n<p>Multiple vaccine candidates must succeed for the world to stamp out the pandemic, which has been on the upswing in the U.S. and Europe. U.S. hospitals have been stretched to the limit as the nation has seen more than 160,000 new cases per day and more than 1,400 daily deaths. Since first emerging nearly a year ago in China, the virus has killed more than 1.4 million people worldwide.</p>\n<p>Moderna is just behind Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech in seeking to begin vaccinations in the U.S. in December. British regulators also are assessing the Pfizer shot and another from AstraZeneca.</p>\n<p>Moderna created its shots with the U.S. National Institutes of Health and already had a hint they were working, but said it got the final needed results over the weekend that suggest the vaccine is more than 94% effective.</p>\n<p>Of 196 COVID-19 cases so far in its huge U.S. study, 185 were trial participants who received the placebo and 11 who got the real vaccine. The only people who got severely ill \u2014 30 participants, including one who died \u2014 had received dummy shots, said Dr. Tal Zaks, the Cambridge, Massachusetts, company\u2019s chief medical officer.</p>\n<p>When he learned the results, \u201cI allowed myself to cry for the first time,\u201d Zaks told The Associated Press. \u201cWe have already, just in the trial, have already saved lives. Just imagine the impact then multiplied to the people who can get this vaccine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Moderna said the shots\u2019 effectiveness and a good safety record so far \u2014 with only temporary, flu-like side effects \u2014 mean they meet requirements set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for emergency use before the final-stage testing is complete. The European Medicines Agency, Europe\u2019s version of FDA, has signaled it also is open to faster \u201cconditional\u201d clearance.</p>\n<p>Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease expert, called that level of protection \u201cextraordinary.\u201d But with a grim few months ahead until enough vaccine arrives, he is pleading with Americans to stick with masks and other critical public health measures.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to continue to do that consistently and uniformly until we get the entire or most of the country vaccinated and have enough herd immunity that we can crush this outbreak,\u201d Fauci told the AP. With vaccines, \u201cwe\u2019ve crushed smallpox, we\u2019ve crushed polio, we\u2019ve crushed measles,\u201d but doing the same for COVID-19 will take time.</p>\n<p>WHAT COMES NEXT</p>\n<p>The FDA has pledged that before it decides to roll out any COVID-19 vaccines, its scientific advisers will publicly debate whether there\u2019s enough evidence behind each candidate. </p>\n<p>First up on Dec. 10, Pfizer and BioNTech will present data suggesting their vaccine candidate is 95% effective. Moderna said its turn at this \u201cscience court\u201d is expected exactly a week later, on Dec. 17.</p>\n<p>RATIONING INITIAL DOSES</p>\n<p>If the FDA allows emergency use, Moderna expects to have 20 million doses ready for the U.S. by year\u2019s end. Recipients will need two doses, so that\u2019s enough for 10 million people. </p>\n<p>Pfizer expects to have 50 million doses globally in December. Half of them \u2014 or enough for 12.5 million people \u2014 are earmarked for the U.S.</p>\n<p>Shipments are set to begin to states within 24 hours of FDA clearance. And this week, a different panel of U.S. experts, established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will meet to decide how those initial supplies will be given out. They\u2019re expected to reserve scarce first doses for health care workers and, if the shots work well enough in the frail elderly, for residents of long-term care facilities. </p>\n<p>As more vaccine gradually becomes available in coming months, other essential workers and people at highest risk from the coronavirus would get in line. But enough for the general U.S. population isn\u2019t expected until at least spring.</p>\n<p>Outside the U.S., Zaks said significant supplies from Moderna would be available later, \u201cin the first quarter\u201d of next year.</p>\n<p>\u201cObviously we are doing everything in our power to increase the capacity and accelerate the timelines,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Britain\u2019s government said Sunday it has ordered 7 million doses from Moderna. </p>\n<p>The U.K. also has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, although it\u2019s not clear how much of the companies\u2019 limited December supply could go toward that order \u2014 if British health authorities clear the shots. Still, British hospitals are gearing up to receive some doses as early as next week.</p>\n<p>Both Moderna\u2019s and Pfizer\u2019s vaccines are made with the same technology, using a piece of genetic code for the \u201cspike\u201d protein that studs the virus. That messenger RNA, or mRNA, instructs the body to make some harmless spike protein, training immune cells to recognize it if the real virus eventually comes along.</p>\n<p>ASTRAZENECA CONFUSION</p>\n<p>AstraZeneca and Oxford University last week announced confusing early results of their vaccine candidate from research in Britain and Brazil.</p>\n<p>That vaccine appears 62% effective when tested as originally intended, with recipients given two full doses. But because of a manufacturing error, a small number of volunteers got a lower first dose \u2014 and AstraZeneca said in that group, the vaccine appeared to be 90% effective. </p>\n<p>Experts say it\u2019s unclear why the lower-dose approach would work better and that it may just be a statistical quirk.</p>\n<p>A larger U.S. study of the AstraZeneca candidate still is underway that should eventually give the FDA a better picture of how well it works. The FDA has said any COVID-19 vaccine would have to be at least 50% effective.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile Britain\u2019s government will have to decide whether its U.K. data is sufficient for an early rollout there.</p>\n<p>STILL IN THE PIPELINE</p>\n<p>Johnson & Johnson also is in final-stage testing in the U.S. and several other countries to see if its vaccine candidate could work with just one dose. </p>\n<p>Both the J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines work by using harmless cold viruses to carry the spike protein gene into the body and prime the immune system. </p>\n<p>The different technologies have ramifications for how easily different vaccines could be distributed globally. The AstraZeneca shots won\u2019t require freezer storage like the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.</p>\n<p>Candidates made with still other technologies are in late-stage testing, too. Another U.S. company, Novavax Inc., announced Monday that it has finished enrolling 15,000 people in a late-stage study in Britain and plans to begin recruiting even more volunteers for final testing in the U.S. and Mexico \u201cin the coming weeks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Vaccines made by three Chinese companies and a Russian candidate also are being tested in thousands of people in countries around the world.</p>\n<p>____</p>\n<p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

                "body": "<p>WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 As two Islamic State militants faced a judge in Virginia last month, Diane Foley listened from home through a muffled phone connection and strained to make out the voices of the men prosecutors say kidnapped her son before he was murdered. </p>\n<p>Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh stand accused of belonging to an IS cell dubbed \u201cthe Beatles,\u201d an incongruously lighthearted nickname for British citizens blamed for the jailing, torture and murder of Western hostages in Syria.</p>\n<p>After geopolitical breakthroughs and stalemates, military actions in Syria and court fights in London, the Justice Department\u2019s most significant terrorism prosecution in years was finally underway. For Foley, who months earlier had pleaded with Attorney General William Barr to pursue justice by forswearing the death penalty, the fact the case was proceeding at all felt miraculous.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019d met so many blocks over the years, I couldn\u2019t believe it was happening,\u201d Foley said. \u201cI was in awe of it, really, and almost didn\u2019t trust it \u2014 a bit incredulous. Is this really happening?\u201d </p>\n<p>The prosecution is a counterterrorism success in the waning weeks of the Trump administration. But it almost didn\u2019t happen. </p>\n<p>Interviews with 11 people connected to the case make clear the hurdles along the way, including a death penalty dispute that required two normally close allies, the U.S. and U.K., to navigate fundamental differences in criminal justice systems. In the end, the interviews show, grieving families reached a gradual consensus to take capital punishment off the table while a key commitment by Barr to do the same enabled the U.S. to obtain crucial evidence it needed.</p>\n<p>At another time, the case might not have even been handled in civilian courts. After the Sept. 11 attacks, the Republican-led Justice Department favored detaining foreign fighters at the U.S. base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for military tribunals. But that approach changed. Now federal prosecutors are pursuing the highest-profile terrorism case since trials over the Boston Marathon  bombing and Benghazi attack, aiming to secure convictions and punishments that can keep the men, in their 30s, imprisoned for life.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere was never a time when I thought we didn\u2019t have any case,\u201d said John Demers, assistant attorney general for national security. But, \u201cwe didn\u2019t want to bring them here unless we had really good charges, a really strong case, and ultimately expected a conviction that was going to result in a very significant prison sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p>The group of militants, called \u201cthe Beatles\u201d by their captives because of their British accents, came to embody IS barbarism with the 2014 release of grisly propaganda videos depicting the beheadings of American hostages. The  first showed James Foley, captured as a freelance journalist covering Syria\u2019s civil war, kneeling in the desert in an orange jumpsuit beside a masked man in black brandishing a knife to his throat.</p>\n<p>The beheadings were part of a reign of terror  that officials say also involved waterboarding, mock executions and electric shocks. Elsheikh once videotaped the shooting of a Syrian hostage as Kotey directed hostages to watch while holding signs pleading for their release, prosecutors say. </p>\n<p>The pair also coordinated ransom demands, the indictment says. An email to the Foleys tauntingly told them the U.S. government treated them \u201clike worthless insects.\u201d </p>\n<p>An airstrike killed the group\u2019s most notorious member, who had killed Foley and was known by the moniker of \u201cJihadi John.\u201d Another was prosecuted in Turkey.</p>\n<p>That left Kotey and Elsheikh, who were captured in Syria in 2018 by American-backed forces. Weeks later, they appeared unapologetic while speaking to The Associated Press at a Kurdish security center, denouncing the U.S. and Britain as hypocrites who wouldn\u2019t give them a fair trial. </p>\n<p>Inside the Justice Department, officials weighed whether the men should be tried in the U.K. or U.S. or even transferred to Guantanamo, which then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions had called a \u201cvery fine place\u201d even though prosecutions there have floundered, lagging behind the speedier justice of American courts.</p>\n<p>U.S. officials initially leaned toward a U.K. prosecution. British authorities had accumulated compelling evidence during their own investigation and U.S. policy encouraged other nations to repatriate and prosecute their citizens who\u2019d joined IS.</p>\n<p>Yet the U.K., which had stripped the men of their British citizenship, resisted doing the case in part over concerns about the ability to get convictions and significant prison sentences in British courts. </p>\n<p>Once that position became clear, officials coalesced around bringing the men to America, said State Department counterterrorism coordinator Nathan Sales. But the British balked at sharing evidence with U.S. prosecutors without assurances they wouldn\u2019t impose the death penalty, which was abolished in the U.K. That was an impediment for American officials, who say they considered Britain\u2019s evidence vital in tracing the men\u2019s travel and path of radicalization. </p>\n<p>They decided they wouldn\u2019t do the case without that evidence, Demers said.</p>\n<p>The British later relented and agreed to share evidence without any assurances. But Elsheikh\u2019s mother sued over the evidence transfer, delaying the case well over a year. Last March, a British court effectively blocked the evidence-sharing over the death penalty issue, a hurdle U.S. officials assumed might require additional litigation to overcome.</p>\n<p>Despite the ruling, prosecutors pressed forward. G. Zachary Terwilliger, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, whose office is handling the case, was among those arguing internally that prosecuting the defendants was more important than leaving the death penalty on the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou certainly can make an argument, and maybe it\u2019s not even a close call, that capital punishment would have been appropriate given the horrific nature of this crime,\u201d Terwilliger said. But, \u201cgetting justice for the victims was paramount to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>The families, too, began uniting around the idea of removing the death penalty from consideration. </p>\n<p>That had long been Diane Foley\u2019s position. The most vocal of the group, she met regularly over the years with government officials and cultivated high-level Washington contacts like her hometown senator, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, with whom she co-authored a 2019 newspaper op-ed warning against \u201cimpunity for these monsters.\u201d</p>\n<p>Still, the budding consensus in recent months was notable because the families had not always shared the same perspective of the case.</p>\n<p>The executions of Foley and two other hostages, Steven Sotloff and Peter Kassig, were documented in propaganda videos, the men\u2019s fates apparent to the world. But the circumstances of the death of a fourth, Kayla Mueller, who prosecutors say was sexually abused by late IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, were less established and her parents initially believed keeping the death penalty on the table could be leverage to get answers. </p>\n<p>Mueller\u2019s mother, Marsha, said in a text message that the couple had not wanted anyone to die but was eager for information about Kayla. </p>\n<p>Ultimately, though, she concluded: \u201cThe other families who we care so deeply for wanted the men brought here and this seemed to be the only way they would come.\u201d</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, current and former FBI officials who were helping the families, including the head of the bureau\u2019s hostage recovery cell, encouraged them to speak out in unison to prod the Trump administration toward prosecution. Ali Soufan, a former FBI counterterrorism agent who\u2019d partnered with Mueller\u2019s parents to investigate Kayla\u2019s death, made the case that waiving the death penalty was essential for cooperating with the U.K. and even customary in international terrorism cases like this one.</p>\n<p>Other options were hardly optimal. A trial in Iraq, where the men had been held in U.S. military custody over the past year, could produce a human rights outcry creating empathy for the men. The proceedings could also result in their release, or potentially execution if they were convicted.</p>\n<p>Concerned a U.S. prosecution might not happen at all, or that the men might be left in Iraq, the families accelerated their public advocacy. In July, all four signed onto an opinion piece in The Washington Post imploring the U.S. to prosecute the pair as a message that anyone who harms American citizens \u201cwill not escape.\u201d That month, NBC News aired an interview with the men in which they admitted involvement in Mueller\u2019s captivity.</p>\n<p>When Foley met with Barr in 2019, he said he shared her desire for accountability. But she said he and other Justice Department officials were firm in their convictions that the death penalty, a punishment Barr had brought back after a 16-year federal government hiatus, was merited.</p>\n<p>Last summer, though, as the families conveyed their wishes to remove death from consideration and as the case dragged on without obvious resolution, Barr was ready to break the logjam.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if it was the deciding factor or not, but I think it did help when we finally spoke up again and said, \u2018Please. Please bring them to the U.S,\u2018\u201d Foley said. \u201cIf you need that evidence and you need to waive the death penalty, please do it.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>A senior Justice Department official prepared Foley for the news about to break, writing in an Aug. 14 email that once the U.S. message is delivered and becomes public, \u201cwe are sure it will generate a lot of attention and discussion \u2014 and that many will be interested to hear from all of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>That happened days later with the release of Barr\u2019s letter to U.K. Home Secretary Priti Patel. In it, he committed to forgo the death penalty but also issued an ultimatum: If the Justice Department received Britain\u2019s evidence by Oct. 15, it would proceed with prosecution. If not, it would transfer the men to Iraqi custody for prosecution.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was a real option. It wasn\u2019t posturing,\u201d Demers said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if the U.K. could do everything it needed to do in time to get us that evidence.\u201d </p>\n<p>The evidence came, resulting in a 24-page indictment with counts punishable by life imprisonment. </p>\n<p>Justice Department prosecutors announced their case on Oct. 7 as the men were flown to Dulles International Airport and taken to jail, where because of the pandemic they faced a judge via video link. They have pleaded not guilty.</p>\n<p>As Foley listened to court proceedings she once doubted would ever come, she couldn\u2019t help but wonder if, under different circumstances, the men might have been friends with James, who years earlier had taught jail inmates.</p>\n<p>But she also is gratified.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo my last dying breath, I will do my best to bring some accountability and justice for the horror of the murders of these four Americans.\u201d</p>"

                "byline": "By LINDSEY BAHR",
                "body": "<p>Director Julia Hart couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Tuesday Weld. She had just watched Michael Mann\u2019s 1981 thriller \u201cThief\u201d and Weld\u2019s character Jessie had taken over her imagination. Where did she and the baby go? What was going through her mind? </p>\n<p>In some ways, Jessie is just the girlfriend. She\u2019s there to up the stakes for the main character and exits the frame when the action begins. It\u2019s not uncommon in the genre. Just think of Michael Corleone closing the door on Kay at the end of \u201cThe Godfather.\u201d </p>\n<p>But, Hart thought, what if we followed the woman instead of the man? It wouldn\u2019t be revisionist or corrective, just a different path. And it was the beginning of the yearslong process of creating \u201cI\u2019m Your Woman,\u201d which turns the lens on the suburban housewife who has to go on the run with a new baby when her criminal husband disappears. The film starring Rachel Brosnahan opens in select theaters Friday and will be available on Amazon Prime Video on Dec. 11.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I want \u2018Thief\u2019 to have followed Jessie,\u201d Hart said. \u201cThe movie was so good that I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about this character and the story of all these women. In these crime dramas, even though the women weren\u2019t the main characters, they were amazing characters. They were complex and flawed and interesting and well performed and well written. They just didn\u2019t get their own movie...That\u2019s what inspired me to create Jean.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hart and her husband, producer Jordan Horowitz, got to work writing the script. And when Amazon Studio heads, who had been impressed with her superhero drama \u201cFast Color,\u201d asked what they wanted to make next, they had this ready to go. </p>\n<p>And after a meeting with Brosnahan, she knew she\u2019d found her Jean.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s such a chameleon,\u201d Hart said. \u201cAnd she feels like a real woman. I think a lot of the women in the 70s movies did as well \u2014 not like someone who had been airbrushed and made to look perfect.\u201d</p>\n<p>The \u201cMarvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d star was all in. Despite her successes over the past few years, she\u2019d been frustrated by the \u201cone-dimensional\u201d roles that were coming her way. Jean was a refreshing departure from that. </p>\n<p>\u201cJean is a quiet woman\u2019s action hero. That\u2019s something that I\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d Brosnahan said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a really nontraditional look at motherhood. Motherhood is more often than not, not the picture perfect journey we see on Instagram.\u201d</p>\n<p>The shoot was going to be hard. Hart knew she\u2019d have her work cut out for herself directing her first car chase and big club scene with hundreds of background actors. But the biggest challenge would be the fact that they\u2019d decided to work with real babies, who in the process of the chronological shoot would go from 6 to 8 months in age. </p>\n<p>\u201cI am constantly frustrated by how people treat babies like they\u2019re not people both in real life and on film \u2014 like it\u2019s fine to have a fake baby or it\u2019s fine to have four different babies playing the same character,\u201d Hart said. \u201cWe knew it was a big risk, but we felt like it was one worth taking. We wanted to commit to making the baby a character in the film who you could connect to and know.\u201d</p>\n<p>It added stress and time restrictions but also beauty and spontaneity to the shoot. </p>\n<p>\u201cThere were times when things happened with those babies that we never could have expected,\u201d Brosnahan said. \u201cAnd that added a layer of magic to certain scenes.\u201d</p>\n<p>In one tense scene where Jean\u2019s home is broken into and she has to hide in the closet and make a desperate phone call, the baby unexpectedly fell asleep in her arms. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt added this layer of urgency,\u201d Brosnahan said. </p>\n<p>And although Hart is proud of the action sequences, the mother of two does not remember feeling more joy and exhilaration than knowing that they got a shot of the baby sleeping. </p>\n<p>\u201cGetting a baby to fall asleep in its period costume, in its period crib at the time when you\u2019re scheduled to shoot it is a bit of a miracle,\u201d Hart said. </p>\n<p>There are exactly two of those miracle shots in the finished film.</p>\n<p>Brosnahan also took on a different kind of role in \u201cI\u2019m Your Woman:\u201d as producer. She\u2019d been thinking about it for some time, \u201clooking for a way to carve out a path for myself.\u201d And she\u2019s immensely grateful to Hart and Horowitz for giving her the opportunity. </p>\n<p>\u201cThis is such a literal example, but most of the time you show up on the set as an actor having never seen what could be your house, the character\u2019s house that they have lived in 30 years. And you\u2019re showing up on day one and trying to pretend you\u2019ve lived there for 30 years,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>As a producer, she was involved in everything from script development to location scouting. When she showed up to her character\u2019s house this time, she knew it already. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt made me a better actor,\u201d she said. </p>\n<p>Hart has spent most of her career as a writer and filmmaker trying to convince studios that stories about women are worth telling. After years of fighting, she\u2019s finally starting to see the change. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe studios are starting to really take female filmmakers and filmmakers of color more seriously,\u201d Hart said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just lip service anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2014-</p>\n<p>Follow AP Film Writer Lindsey Bahr on Twitter: www.twitter.com/ldbahr</p>"

                "body": "<p>Minnesota announced Monday it has called off this weekend\u2019s game against No. 16 Northwestern, the second straight cancellation for the Gophers due to a spike in COVID-19 cases within the program.</p>\n<p>University officials made the decision in consultation with the Big Ten after seven additional positive cases were confirmed. The Wildcats, who lead the West Division by one game at 5-1, were scheduled to play Saturday at TCF Bank Stadium. Those Gophers who\u2019ve contracted the virus have experienced \u201cvery, very mild symptoms,\u201d according to coach P.J. Fleck.</p>\n<p>College football is limping toward the postseason in late December as multiple programs deal with COVID-19 outbreaks and contact tracing protocols. Four games on this week\u2019s schedule have been postponed or canceled. Over the last three weeks, 52 games have been called off because of COVID-19 issues out of 179 that were scheduled. Since late August, the total number of canceled or postponed games is 103.</p>\n<p>Minnesota\u2019s football team has turned up 47 positive cases since Nov. 19 \u2014 21 players and 26 staff members. The Gophers paused all team activities six days ago, when they canceled the annual rivalry game at Wisconsin. Minnesota also said it will hold all meetings virtually for the rest of the season. Left on the schedule is a game at Nebraska on Dec. 12 and a to-be-determined cross-division opponent on Dec. 19. </p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot we can do about it. Nobody\u2019s doing anything wrong. The virus remains undefeated,\u201d Fleck said on his weekly radio appearance on KFAN-FM. \u201cWe are in a major city, surrounded by a lot of people.\u201d</p>\n<p>The university is working with the state health department to isolate and treat the individuals who\u2019ve tested positive. Last week, Minnesota added testing beyond the conference\u2019s established protocols.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe health and safety of our student-athletes, coaches and staff continues to be our main priority,\u201d athletic director Mark Coyle said. \u201cThe last couple of days have shown a decrease in positive cases, but not to the point where we are able to return to competition.\u201d</p>\n<p>Coyle said the Gophers are aiming to play Nebraska as scheduled, and Fleck said the team is game-planning for the Huskers. </p>\n<p>The virus has done a number on the Big Ten race, with six cancellations so far. The 18th-ranked Badgers have likely become ineligible for the conference championship because they haven\u2019t played enough games. East Division leader and third-ranked Ohio State, which had to cancel its last game against Illinois, would be in danger of that fate with one more cancellation. </p>\n<p>COLLEGE BASKETBALL</p>\n<p>The pandemic is also disrupting the early days of the college basketball season, with coaches scrambling to fill holes in the schedule. The 21st-ranked Oregon men\u2019s basketball program announced it would play two games in Omaha, Nebraska \u2014 against Missouri on Wednesday and Seton Hall on Friday.</p>\n<p>Oregon is yet to open its basketball season because of the COVID-19-related cancelations of multi-team events the Ducks hoped to play in as well as a game against Eastern Washington.</p>\n<p>Ducks coach Dana Altman was the longtime coach at Creighton, in Omaha, before leaving for Oregon and he has remained close friends with athletic director Bruce Rasmussen.</p>\n<p>Seton Hall (0-1), like Creighton, plays in the Big East. Rasmussen served as the middleman to get the Ducks and Pirates together on Creighton\u2019s home court at the CHI Health Center. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t make a lot of sense for Oregon to go all the way to New Jersey or for Seton Hall to go all the way to Oregon,\u201d Rasmussen said, \u201cso we helped them get the game here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oregon scheduled the impromptu game against Missouri on its own and might look for more games in Omaha after the Seton Hall game.</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>More AP college football coverage: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://apnews.com/AP_Top25</p>"

                "body": "<p>HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 A Central Texas county has closed its bars after area hospitalizations for COVID-19 exceeded a state mandated limit.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile in Houston, officials say they are having problems with some bars that have been allowed to reopen as restaurants but are not enforcing rules related to social distancing and mask wearing. </p>\n<p>McLennan County Judge Scott Felton on Sunday closed bars and reduced capacity to 50% at stores, restaurants and other businesses. The action comes after the area\u2019s hospitalization rate for patients with COVID-19 went above 15% for seven consecutive days. </p>\n<p>The shut down and reduction in capacity is due to a rule announced in October by Gov. Greg Abbott, who allowed bars to reopen and other businesses to expand capacity as long as COVID-19 hospitalizations stay below 15%. </p>\n<p>On Monday, COVID-19 patients accounted for 18.4 percent of the hospitalizations in the state trauma service area comprised of McLennan and four other surrounding counties. </p>\n<p>Felton told the Waco Tribune-Herald he doesn\u2019t expect the hospitalization rate to improve in the short term.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you think about it, we were in an upward trend before the Thanksgiving holiday,\u201d he told the newspaper. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting there will be an increased amount of positive cases because of the holiday and the fact people are getting together.</p>\n<p>Texas on Monday recorded 10,714 new coronavirus cases and 22 new deaths, health officials announced. In the state, 8,900 people were hospitalized with COVID-19, the highest since August. </p>\n<p>The rising number of patients is pushing Texas hospitals to the the limits as health officials brace for a disastrous worsening of the surge nationwide because of holiday gatherings over the long weekend. </p>\n<p>One in every 401 people in Texas tested positive in the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University. </p>\n<p>The actual number of cases is believed to be far higher because many people haven\u2019t been tested and some who get the disease don\u2019t show symptoms.</p>\n<p>For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms that clear up within weeks. But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, the virus can cause severe symptoms and be fatal. The vast majority of people recover.</p>\n<p>In Houston, Mayor Sylvester Turner said he planned to start visiting bars that have reopened as restaurants to ensure they are following rules related to occupancy limits, social distancing and mask wearing and are not becoming \u201ccommunity spreader\u201d events. </p>\n<p>This comes after videos were shared on social media of a concert last week at Houston\u2019s Spire night club where people were shoulder-to-shoulder and most were not wearing masks. </p>\n<p>Harris County, where Houston is located, has not allowed bars to reopen. Since the summer, the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission has let bars apply to operate as restaurants as long as they offer food and ensure that less than 51% of their total revenue comes from alcohol sales. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe are trying to strike a very delicate balance in protecting the public\u2019s and community\u2019s health and at the same time wanting to keep businesses open. We\u2019re asking people and businesses to work with us,\u201d Turner said. </p>\n<p>Officials in other Texas cities have also expressed concerns about bars reclassified as restaurants not following state guidelines on social distancing and occupancy limits. Officials across the country have closed bars during the pandemic as some studies have shown that bars, restaurants and other crowded indoor spaces can help spread the virus. </p>\n<p>In an email, the TABC said it is investigating the Houston night club after last week\u2019s incident. The night club previously had its liquor license suspended in July and October for non-compliance with the state\u2019s COVID-19 guidelines.</p>\n<p>The night club did not immediately return a call seeking comment Monday. </p>\n<p>The TABC has received about 3,000 requests from bars seeking reclassification as restaurants in Texas and about 2,800 have been approved.</p>\n<p>\u201cTABC takes the safety of Texas businesses and their customers extremely seriously,\u201d the agency said Monday in an email. \u201cThe vast majority of businesses are doing what they can to protect their customers and staff and have repeatedly shown that they place safety first.\u201d</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>Associated Press writer Paul J.

                "body": "<p>WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 For the first time under new coach Ron Rivera, Washington is the proud owner of a two-game winning streak. </p>\n<p>So what if those victories came against a pair of opponents (Dallas and Cincinnati) who are without their preferred starting QBs and are a combined 5-16-1? </p>\n<p>And so what if the latest win, 41-16 at the Cowboys on Thanksgiving Day, came with some help from a foe in the form of highly questionable coaching?</p>\n<p>Also of note: Pending the outcome of Philadelphia\u2019s game against Seattle on Monday night, Washington was essentially tied for first place in the NFC East with the New York Giants. </p>\n<p>So what if Rivera\u2019s team is just 4-7 (and technically trailing New York because the Giants swept the rivals\u2019 two meetings this season)?</p>\n<p>The truth is, good news has been so scarce for so long for Washington, any shred of success seems like a big deal. Now, though, comes a stretch that should make clear whether it really makes sense to even consider the possibility of a division title. </p>\n<p>First \u2014 as of now anyway, with the NFL pushing ahead amid a pandemic \u2014 comes a matchup rescheduled from next Sunday to next Monday at the Pittsburgh Steelers, winners of their first 10 games.</p>\n<p>That is supposed to be followed by a game against San Francisco (5-6) and old friend Kyle Shanahan, who made it to last season\u2019s Super Bowl. That game is being shifted to the Arizona Cardinals\u2019 stadium, because the 49ers were forced out of their usual digs due to the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>\n<p>The upcoming trio of games wraps up at home against Russell Wilson and the Seahawks, who started 7-3.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese three teams certainly will be measuring sticks for us,\u201d Rivera said Monday. \u201cRight now, in the AFC, Pittsburgh\u2019s the elite. Then we\u2019re going to go up against San Francisco, who was the elite last year and they\u2019re finding their way back. And then Seattle, who is one of the elite right now. So it\u2019s going to be a good test. We\u2019ll see how we handle it.\u201d</p>\n<p>WHAT\u2019S WORKING</p>\n<p>A defensive line anchored by No. 2 overall pick Chase Young and fellow first-rounders Jonathan Allen, Daron Payne and Montez Sweat. After four sacks against Dallas, Washington\u2019s 36 rank second in the league; Sweat chipped in with a pick-6 of Andy Dalton. </p>\n<p>WHAT NEEDS HELP</p>\n<p>Washington\u2019s propensity to give up big plays: It has allowed nine of 50 yards or more; only one club in the entire NFL (the Chargers, 3-8) is worse, with 10. </p>\n<p>STOCK UP</p>\n<p>Rookie running back Antonio Gibson is showing more and more signs of establishing himself as a consistent contributor. He was listed as a wide receiver in college at Memphis, although he also was used out of the backfield and as a kick returner. On Thursday, the third-round draft pick touched the ball on 16 of Washington\u2019s initial 29 offensive snaps, finishing with 20 carries for 115 yards and three TDs, along with five catches for 21 yards. He\u2019s scored 11 times, all on the ground. \u201cThe biggest thing with Antonio right now,\u201d Rivera said, \u201cis we\u2019re seeing growth in many places.\u201d </p>\n<p>STOCK DOWN</p>\n<p>Cornerback Ronald Darby\u2019s attempt to cover Cowboys wideout Amari Copper was a rare lowlight Thursday. Darby got beaten on a 54-yard touchdown pass from Dalton to Cooper early in the second quarter that put Dallas ahead 10-7. Darby also was called for pass interference while on Cooper in that period\u2019s final minute, a 28-yard penalty that helped lead to a field goal.</p>\n<p>INJURED</p>\n<p>Compared to the general injury-depleted nature of NFL rosters, Washington has fared fairly well. Free safety Deshazor Everett missed the past two games because of an injured ankle, with Troy Apke starting in his place alongside rookie Kamren Curl, a seventh-round draft pick who took over at strong safety when Landon Collins was lost for the season with an injured Achilles tendon. Morgan Moses has filled in capably at left tackle after three others at that spot got hurt; Moses\u2019 usual job at right tackle went to David Sharpe.</p>\n<p>KEY NUMBER</p>\n<p>0 \u2014 Total points for Washington on 11 game-opening drives, including a three-and-out possession Thursday. </p>\n<p>NEXT STEPS</p>\n<p>With the way things are going, it\u2019s hard to know what to expect with one item that usually is a known quantity: the schedule. So with the pandemic surging around the United States, there is no guarantee Washington will actually play at Pittsburgh on Dec. 7. \u201cThe biggest thing we told the guys was: Be ready. We\u2019re coming back to work on Wednesday; just be ready for whatever happens,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of in that situation right now throughout the league. We\u2019re kind of a touch-and-go.\u201d </p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL</p>"
